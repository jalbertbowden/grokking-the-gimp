4.1 Channel Masks
</H1>

<P>
A channel mask is a special grayscale layer only 8 bits deep and is
used to store and edit selections.  This section describes the
Channels dialog, how to save selections to channel masks, how to
convert channel masks to selections, and the other GIMP functions used
for organizing masks and operating on them.

4.1.1 The Channels Dialog
</H2>

<P>
As an image can have any number of layers, it can also have any number
of channel masks.  Thus, analogous to the Layers dialog, the Channels
dialog is the the tool for organizing and working with channels.  The
Channels dialog is obtained by typing <TT>C-l</TT> in the image window
and clicking on the Channels tab in the resulting <TT>Layers &amp;
Channels</TT> window.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channels-dialogX">4.1</A>

ALT="Figure 4.1"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
illustrates the various elements of the Channels dialog.

<P>
The most important feature of the Channels dialog is the Channels
Palette.<A NAME="5191">&#160;</A><A NAME="5192">&#160;</A>
This region of the dialog consists of horizontal strips where the top
three entries are always the Red, Green, and Blue channels of the
image, already described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#s2.layers.channel-dialog">2.2.1</A>.
The rest of the strips are channel masks.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channels-dialogX">4.1</A> shows a single channel mask.
The channel mask strip displays a thumbnail image of the mask's
contents, and the area to the left of the thumbnail contains an Eye
icon.  Analogous to layer strips in the Layers dialog, the
visibility<A NAME="5195">&#160;</A><A NAME="5196">&#160;</A> of the Eye icon for channel strips can be toggled on and off,
making the channel mask either visible or invisible in the image
window.

<P>
To the right of the thumbnail is the Channel Title
Area.  In
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channels-dialogX">4.1</A> the channel is named A Channel
Mask.  The title can be changed by double-clicking in the Channel
Title Area.  This brings up a dialog where the new title can be
entered.

<P>
The channel strip in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channels-dialogX">4.1</A> is
highlighted in blue, indicating that it is the active
channel.<A NAME="5199">&#160;</A>  A channel mask is made active by
clicking on its thumbnail or Title Area.  Only a single channel mask
can be active at a time, and, when a channel mask is active, none of
the image layers can be active.  Because GIMP tools applied to the
image window are applied to the active layer<A NAME="5200">&#160;</A> or
the active channel,<A NAME="5201">&#160;</A> this can sometimes be a
source of confusion.  After working on a channel mask, to work on a
layer it is necessary to explicitly switch to the Layers dialog and to
make the layer active.

<P>
The remaining elements of the Channels dialog are the Channels menu
and the button bar.  These are described in more detail shortly.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001212000000000000000">
4.1.2 Saving Selections to Channel Masks</A>
</H2>

<P>
One of the primary uses you will make of channel masks is to save
selections.  Why should you save a selection to a channel?  There are
many reasons.  The first is that saving the selection protects your
work, which is particularly important if you are making an involved
and difficult selection.  Second, it allows you to make your
selections in parts.  This helps divide and simplify the work.  Third,
it allows you to reuse a selection for several purposes.  This is
useful for all sorts of rendering operations, such as making drop
shadows, highlights, and special textures (for example, see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node76.html#s8.proj1">8.5</A>).  Fourth, it allows you to refine your
selections in ways that would otherwise be impossible.  Finally, many
special effects can be had using filter plug-ins on masks.  As you can
see, saving a selection to a channel mask really has a very broad
range of benefits.

<P>
After making a selection with any of the tools described in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node35.html#c3.selections">3</A>, we can save the selection to a channel
mask using the <TT>Save To Channel</TT><A NAME="5206">&#160;</A> function, found in the <TT>Image:Select</TT> menu.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.select2channel">4.2</A>(a)

illustrates an image of a selected falcon, and
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.select2channel">4.2</A>(b) shows the Channels dialog after
having used the <TT>Save to Channel</TT><A NAME="5216">&#160;</A>
function.  The thumbnail appears as a grayscale image, where white
corresponds to fully selected, gray to partially<A NAME="5217">&#160;</A> selected, and black to unselected
pixels.  As seen in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.select2channel">4.2</A>(b), the
default channel mask title is Selection Mask copy.

<P>
After using <TT>Save to Channel</TT>, the active focus changes from the
Layers dialog to the newly created channel in the Channels dialog.
Nevertheless, the selection in the image window remains active.  This
has several important consequences.  First, since the new channel is
active, all ensuing filtering or painting operations are applied only
to this channel.  Furthermore, since the original selection is still
active, the only parts of the new channel that can be affected are
those inside the selection area.  For example, trying to paint outside
the selection will have absolutely no effect.

<P>
Thus, if the objective is to work on the newly created channel, the
selection must be canceled by typing <TT>C-S-a</TT> in the image window,
and the channel must be made visible by toggling on its Eye icon in
the Channels dialog.  If the objective is to save the selection as a
channel and to move onto other image operations, the selection
must be canceled, and the appropriate layer in the Layers dialog must
be made active.

<P>

4.1.3 Making Channel Masks Visible</A>
</H2>

<P>
A channel mask's visibility can be toggled on or off by clicking on
its Eye icon.  Looking again at
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.select2channel">4.2</A>(b), the Eye icon is not visible.
Toggling it on, as shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channel-mask">4.3</A>(b), and
toggling off the image layer's visibility produces the result shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channel-mask">4.3</A>(a).

If the Eye icon of the image layer is toggled back on, as shown in

The image layer can now be seen through the channel mask.  The parts
of the image corresponding to the white region of the mask appear
clearly, but the parts in the black region appear covered by a dark,
semi-transparent film.  This demonstrates why these channels are
called masks; they allow the selected parts of the image to be clearly
seen while ``masking out'' the unselected parts.

<P>
Being able to see the image through the filmy parts of the channel
mask, as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channel-mask-x0">4.4</A>(a), makes
it possible to edit the mask according to the features of the image
behind it.  In this way, the channel mask is like a piece of digital
tracing paper placed over the image.

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
This dialog allows three mask attributes to be set: the Channel name,
the Fill Opacity, and the mask color.  Setting the name is
self-explanatory, but the other two attributes merit some discussion.

<P>
The <TT>Fill Opacity</TT> slider sets the degree to which the image layer
is visible through the filmy parts of the mask.  The slider's units
are in percent so if the opacity is set to 100, the only parts of the
image that are visible are those that correspond to the white part of
the mask, and the parts of the image corresponding to the black parts
of the mask cannot be seen.  Alternatively, if the opacity is set to
0, the image layer is completely visible, and the mask cannot be seen.
An intermediate opacity setting allows the masked-out regions of the
image to be seen through the black part of the mask.  Adjusting the
Fill Opacity slider allows an optimum working level to be set for the
mask.

<P>
If some of the image pixels seen behind the semi-opacity of the mask
are dark, it will be difficult to see the details of these pixels.
This may impede your ability to make useful edits to the mask,
regardless of the Fill Opacity slider's setting.  This is why the
color of the mask can be changed.  Changing the mask's color is done
by clicking in the color patch of the <TT>Channel Options</TT> dialog.
This brings up the <TT>Color Selection</TT> dialog, from which any color
can be chosen.  A good choice, of course, is one that contrasts well
with the image layer pixels.  Closing the <TT>Color Selection</TT> dialog
changes the color in the <TT>Channel Options</TT> color rectangle.
Closing the <TT>Channel Options</TT> dialog makes this color appear at
the chosen opacity level in the image window.  This is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channel-mask-y">4.5</A>(a), where a 50%-transparent red
has been chosen for the mask color.

<P>
The Channels dialog, like the Layers dialog, has a hidden menu that

the functions in the menu are organizational: <TT>New Channel</TT>, <TT>Raise Channel</TT>, <TT>Lower Channel</TT>, <TT>Duplicate Channel</TT>, and <TT>Delete Channel</TT> are all self-explanatory.  Of particular importance is
the <TT>Channel to Selection</TT> function, which is the inverse of the
<TT>Save to Channel</TT><A NAME="5276">&#160;</A>
function.  <TT>Channel to Selection</TT><A NAME="5278">&#160;</A><A NAME="5279">&#160;</A> creates a

4.1.6 Combining Channels
</H2>

<P>
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#s3-2.combining-selections">3.2</A> describes how selections can
be combined; selections can be added, subtracted, and intersected.
These operations are useful because they allow the results from
different selection tools to be combined and because they also allow
the work to be performed incrementally.  This can be particularly
important when selecting from a large image or when making a
complicated selection.

<P>
Channel masks can also be combined.  This is done by converting the
masks to selections and then saving the combined result back to a
mask.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine1">4.7</A>

illustrates the procedure.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine1">4.7</A>(a) shows an
underwater scene for which two selections have been previously made
and saved to channel masks.  The channels strips for the two masks,
labeled Fish and Rock, can be seen in the Channels dialog, shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine1">4.7</A>(b).

<P>
After making the channel labeled Rock the active channel, it is
converted to a selection by clicking on the <TT>Channel to Selection</TT>
button (represented by the dashed circle icon) in the button bar.  The
active channel can be seen in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine2">4.8</A>(b).

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine2">4.8</A>(a) shows the resulting selection in
the image window.  Note that it was not necessary nor useful to toggle
on the visibility of the channel mask to do this.

<P>
A similar operation is performed with the channel mask labeled Fish.
The mask is made active and then converted to a selection.  Normally
the conversion of a mask to a selection replaces any selection already
active in the image window.  However, the selection represented by the
mask can also be added to the active selection.  This is accomplished
by choosing the <TT>Add to Selection</TT><A NAME="5308">&#160;</A> function from the Channels menu, shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.channel-menu">4.6</A>(b).  The <TT>Add to Selection</TT>
function can also be invoked by Shift-clicking the <TT>Channel to
Selection</TT> button in the button bar.  The result of adding the
selection is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine3">4.9</A>(a),

which shows the combined selection in the image window.

<P>
Two other combining modes are also available in the Channels menu.
These are the <TT>Subtract From Selection</TT> and the <TT>Intersect
With Selection</TT> functions.  These can both be used from the <TT>Channel to Selection</TT> button in the button bar.  Control-clicking the
button produces a subtraction and Control-Shift-clicking produces an
intersection.

<P>
The final step to obtain a channel mask of the combined selection is
performed by using <TT>Save to Channel</TT> from the <TT>Image:Select</TT>
menu.  The procedure is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#f.masks.combine4">4.10</A>.

4.1.7 Partially Selected Pixels
</H2>

<P>
Partially selected pixels are especially important at selection edges
because they allow the selection to blend more smoothly with other
image layers.  The subject of partially selected pixels has already
been discussed to some extent in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3-5.tool-options">3.1.2</A>,
which presented the concepts antialiasing and feathering.

<P>
A powerful feature of masks is that they provide an easy way to create
and to work with partially selected pixels.  As has already been
discussed, a white pixel in a channel mask represents a fully selected
pixel in the image window, a black pixel fully unselected, and a gray
pixel partially selected.  Thus, channel masks allow for partially
selected pixels, and, moreover, provide a framework on which any of
the GIMP's filters and functions can be applied.  This makes channel
masks a particularly flexible and versatile medium for working with
partial selections.  Some examples of using GIMP filters on masks are
illustrated in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node45.html#s4.masks.anti-alias_and_feathering">4.3.5</A>.
