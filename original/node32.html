2.6 Manipulating Layers
</H1>

<P>
As already discussed, layers are the most important image components
for image manipulation.  They are the basic raw materials you want to
work with and combine.  In most every GIMP project, layers need to be
moved, resized, positioned, transformed, cut, pasted, and so on.
These types of layer operations are discussed in this section.

2.6.1 Positioning Layers
</H2>

<P>
One of the most basic layer operations is positioning.  Compositing
from a set of raw image materials requires that the various
components, each on a separate layer, be appropriately positioned.
This section describes several techniques for layer positioning.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION001061100000000000000">&#160;</A>

<BR>
2.6.1.1 Moving Layers
</H3>

<P>
Moving a layer is accomplished using the <TT>Move</TT><A NAME="2142">&#160;</A>
tool.  This tool is invoked by clicking on the Toolbox button
displaying the four-way arrow icon.  Clicking on this tool changes the
mouse cursor to a four-way arrow when it is in the image window.
Clicking and dragging while the cursor is in the image window causes
the layer underneath the mouse cursor to move.  The layer affected is
the one that is highest in the layer stack and has pixels more than
50% opaque under the mouse cursor (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node56.html#s5.opacity-transparency">5.7</A> for more on opacity and
transparency).  This means that if the top layer is transparent at the
mouse cursor position, it is not moved.  This also means that if the
active layer is transparent at the mouse cursor position it is not
moved.  Rather, it is the first layer from the top that has more than
50% opaque pixels under the mouse cursor that is moved.
Alternatively, the active layer can be forced to move by
Shift-clicking and dragging.  This moves the active layer regardless
of its visibility, degree of transparency, or position with respect to
the cursor.

2.6.1.2 Aligning Layers with Guides
</H3>

<P>
Sometimes a layer needs to be positioned more carefully than can be
easily judged by eye.  Under these circumstances, it is often
convenient to use guides to facilitate their placement.  Guides are
useful because they have a snapping property<A NAME="2149">&#160;</A>.  A layer released sufficiently near a guide will jump to
the guide position.  The snapping property of guides is controlled by
the <TT>Snap to Guides</TT> checkbox in the <TT>Image:View</TT> menu.  The
checkbox must be toggled on for the snapping property to work.

<P>
To illustrate how guides are useful for layer positioning, the three
planet images shown in Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.guides1">2.13</A>(a), (b), and (c)

were each copied and pasted to new layers in a larger image window
with a black background.  This is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.guides2">2.14</A>.

<BR>
<P>
The objective is to organize the planets on a diagonal, but with a
uniform black border between them and the window edge.  This was done
by placing two horizontal and two vertical guides in the image window,
each positioned exactly three ruler tick marks from the edge.  Where
do the guides come from?  Well, they are hidden inside the rulers at
the left and top edges of the image window.  Clicking on a ruler and
then dragging the mouse into the image window drags a guide along with
it.  Releasing the mouse button positions the guide.  Any number of
guides can be created in this way.  Once the guides are positioned,
their visibility can be toggled on or off with the <TT>Toggle
Guides</TT><A NAME="2165">&#160;</A> function, found in the <TT>Image:View</TT> menu, or by typing <TT>C-S-t</TT> in the image window.

<P>
The guides can be seen in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.guides2">2.14</A> as blue dashed
lines.  The Jupiter and Earth layers were positioned with the <TT>Move</TT> tool so that their corners were aligned at the cross-hairs of
the guides.  It can be seen that the active layer, designated by the
yellow dashed boundaries shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.guides2">2.14</A>, are
perfectly aligned with the guides.  That the layers snapped to the
guides simplified the positioning operation.  When no longer needed,
the guides can be moved off the image by first activating the <TT>Move</TT> tool from the Toolbox and then using the mouse to drag the
guides back into the rulers.

2.6.1.3 Toggling the Layer Boundary
</H3>
  
Careful alignment or color matching between layers is often required
for layer edges that are overlapping or abutting.  The layer
boundaries of the active layer can be seen in the image window, even
when the layer contents cannot be seen.  This boundary, consisting of
a black-and-yellow dashed line, can impede the precision with which
alignment and color matching work is performed.  Under these
circumstances it is useful to visually toggle off the layer
boundaries, which is easily done with the <TT>Toggle Selection</TT>
function, found in the <TT>Image:View</TT> menu.  Alternatively, <TT>C-t</TT> can be typed in the image window.  The
visibility of the layer boundaries is restored by toggling a second
time.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001062000000000000000">
2.6.2 Resizing and Scaling</A>
</H2>

<P>
As was seen in Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node27.html#f.layers.layer-stack2">2.2</A> and
<A HREF="node30.html#f.layers.copy-paste2">2.10</A>(a), the layers in an image need not all be
the same size.  Furthermore, changing a layer's dimensions can be
quite useful.  In the parlance of the GIMP, a layer can be <EM>resized</EM>, which means that its boundaries are shrunk or enlarged
without changing the dimensions of the image's contents.
Alternatively, a layer can be <EM>scaled</EM>, which means that the
dimensions of the layer are changed and the image contents are
stretched or squeezed to exactly fit within the new layer boundaries.
Six functions in the GIMP resize or scale layers and images:
<UL>
<LI><TT>Layer Boundary Size</TT>, found in the Layers menu
<LI><TT>Scale Layer</TT>, found in the Layers menu
<LI><TT>Canvas Size</TT>, found in the <TT>Image:Image</TT> menu

<LI>The <TT>Crop</TT> tool from the Toolbox
<LI>The <TT>Transform</TT> tool from the Toolbox

2.6.2.1 Image Scaling

<P>
Scaling an image results in changing the dimensions of all the layers
at once, while simultaneously stretching or squeezing the image
contents to fit.  The function <TT>Scale Image</TT><A NAME="2198">&#160;</A>, found in the <TT>Image:Image</TT> menu, is the tool that
accomplishes this.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.scale-image">2.15</A>(a)

the <TT>Scale Image</TT><A NAME="2208">&#160;</A> dialog.  The new width
and height of the image can be specified in pixels or as a percentage
of the current dimensions.  The default is to scale the two dimensions
proportionally, but this can be changed by toggling the chain icon
next to the Ratio X and Y entry boxes.  The result of scaling down the
image shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.scale-image">2.15</A>(a) by 75% is shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.scale-image">2.15</A>(c).  The result of scaling it up

2.6.2.2 Image Resizing
</H3>

<P>
At first blush it would seem that the <TT>Canvas Size</TT><A NAME="2217">&#160;</A> function found in the <TT>Image:Image</TT> menu should
work in a similar fashion to <TT>Scale Image</TT>.  However, there is an
important difference between resizing an image and scaling it.
Because the image contents do not change with the image boundaries,
there is a non-unique choice in how they are positioned within the
resized image window.  Thus, when resizing to a smaller image window,
the position of the image within the new window depends on the values
for the new width, height, and X and Y offsets.

inconvenient problem.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-a">2.16</A>(a)
shows the original image, and
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-a">2.16</A>(b) shows the <TT>Set
Canvas Size</TT> dialog.  In the dialog the X and Y ratios have been set
to 50% of the original image size.  The result is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-a">2.16</A>(c).  As can be seen, the
image is poorly positioned within the new window.  This can be
compensated for by using the <TT>Move</TT> tool to reposition the image
inside the window.  The result of doing this is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-a">2.16</A>(d).  However, the result
still leaves the image subject, the wolf's head, poorly framed.  The
problem is that there is no easy way to enter numbers into the <TT>Set Canvas Size</TT><A NAME="2234">&#160;</A> dialog to obtain an
aesthetically pleasing result.

<P>
A better solution is to resize the image interactively using the <TT>Crop</TT><A NAME="2236">&#160;</A><A NAME="2237">&#160;</A> tool.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-b">2.17</A>

illustrates how the original image can be resized smaller this way.
The tool is applied by clicking on the <TT>Crop</TT> tool icon in the
Toolbox and then clicking and dragging in the image window to create
the crop rectangle.  Once drawn, the dimensions of the crop rectangle
can be adjusted by clicking and dragging either the upper-left or
lower-right corners of the rectangle.  The rectangle can also be
repositioned by clicking and dragging the upper-right or lower-left
corners.

<P>
The result of using the <TT>Crop</TT> tool to nicely frame the wolf's
head is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-b">2.17</A>(a).
When using this tool, the Crop dialog appears, as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-b">2.17</A>(b).  It is possible to
crop the image by clicking on the Crop button in the dialog or by
simply clicking inside the crop rectangle in the image window.  This
makes the image smaller and simultaneously discards the image parts
outside of the window.  Alternatively, the image can be resized by
clicking on the Resize button in the Crop dialog.  This makes the
image window smaller <EM>without</EM> discarding the image parts outside
the resulting window.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-b">2.17</A>(c) shows the result of
cropping the image to the crop rectangle seen in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize-image-smaller-b">2.17</A>(a).  From the above
discussion, it should be clear that there is really no reason to use
<TT>Canvas Size</TT> to make an image window smaller.  It is simply more
convenient to do it with the <TT>Crop</TT> tool.

<P>
Although <TT>Canvas Size</TT> is not optimum for making an image smaller,
it is quite useful for making it larger.  This is especially valuable
when compositing several raw images.  Typically you discover, after
positioning various imported layers, that the resulting image window
is not large enough to adequately frame the composition.  When this
happens, <TT>Canvas Size</TT> is the tool that fixes the problem.

2.6.2.3 Layer Scaling
</H3>

<P>
As has already been discussed in this section, it is possible to scale
an entire image.  However, it is also possible to scale a single layer
within an image.  There are two tools for doing this in the GIMP: the
<TT>Scale Layer</TT><A NAME="2271">&#160;</A> function, found in the
Layers menu, and the <TT>Transform</TT><A NAME="2273">&#160;</A> tool in the
Toolbox.

<P>
As for entire images, a layer can be scaled either smaller or larger.
The most typical use of layer scaling is to adjust the relative size
of an image on one layer with respect to an image in another.  This is
needed for almost every compositing project (for examples, see
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#c7.compositing">7</A>).  When it is necessary to scale a layer
smaller, either the <TT>Scale Layer</TT> function or the scaling option
of the <TT>Transform</TT> tool will do the trick.  However, the <TT>Transform</TT> tool might be preferable because it provides interactive
control of the scaling process.  <TT>Scale Layer</TT> relies on entering
numbers into entry boxes in a dialog.  It is difficult to choose the
correct dimensions, which leads to repeatedly applying <TT>Scale
Layer</TT> and <TT>Undo</TT> until the desired effect is achieved.

<P>
The problem of finding the right dimensions to scale a layer can
sometimes be solved using the <TT>Measure</TT><A NAME="2282">&#160;</A> tool,
which is discussed in more detail in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#s2.layers.transformations">2.6.5</A>.  A good example of using the
<TT>Measure</TT> tool to determine the appropriate amount to rescale a
layer is given in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#s7.panoramas">7.5</A>.  Alternatively, the <TT>Transform</TT> tool provides interactive visual feedback of the scaling
process.  In addition, it can be used in conjunction with the <TT>Bezier Path</TT><A NAME="2288">&#160;</A> tool and the Transform
Lock<A NAME="2289">&#160;</A> icon in the Paths dialog to get very
fine, interactive scaling control.  The technique for this is
discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#s3.path-palette">3.4.1</A>, and a relevant example is
shown in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node67.html#s7.compositing.proj2">7.2</A>.

<P>
Scaling a layer larger should be avoided if possible, because this
operation requires the interpolation<A NAME="2292">&#160;</A> of
pixel<A NAME="2293">&#160;</A> values.  Interpolation is
an approximation process that creates pixels where there were none
before and that, consequently, partially degrades the layer's image
quality.  Thus, when adjusting the relative sizes of several image
components on different layers, it is preferable to scale down the
larger components to match the size of the smaller ones rather than
vice versa.

<P>
In the event that it is necessary to scale a layer larger, it is
important to know that a layer cannot be scaled to dimensions larger
than those of the existing image boundaries.  To scale a layer to
dimensions greater than these limits, the image window must first be
resized larger using the function <TT>Canvas Size</TT>, previously
discussed.

2.6.2.4 Layer Resizing
</H3>

<P>
As with scaling, a layer can be resized smaller or larger.  This is
done with <TT>Layer Boundary Size</TT>,<A NAME="2300">&#160;</A> found
in the Layers menu.  Typically you resize a layer to a smaller
dimension to eliminate undesirable parts.  However, resizing a layer
smaller has the same problem as resizing an image.  That is, the
subject matter of the layer must be properly positioned within the
resulting layer boundaries.  For images, the positioning problem was
solved using the <TT>Crop</TT> tool, but this will not work for resizing
layers.  Fortunately there is a simple procedure that produces the
same effect and allows for the interactive positioning of the layer
contents within the smaller layer boundaries.

how this is done.  The method consists of a four-step procedure:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The region to be framed in the layer is selected with the <TT>Rectangle Select</TT><A NAME="2316">&#160;</A> tool (see
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node35.html#c3.selections">3</A> for more on selections).
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize1">2.19</A>(a) shows how a rectangular selection has
been made in an image window.
<DT>2.
<DD>The selection is then converted to a floating selection using the
function <TT>Float</TT><A NAME="2320">&#160;</A> from the <TT>Image:Select</TT>
menu or by typing <TT>C-S-l</TT> in the image window.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize1">2.19</A>(b) shows the Layers dialog after the
selection has been converted to a float.
<DT>3.
<DD>The floating selection is then made into a new layer by choosing the
<TT>New Layer</TT> function in the Layers menu or by clicking the <TT>New Layer</TT> button in the Layers dialog.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize2">2.20</A>(a) shows the Layers dialog corresponding
to this step.
<DT>4.
<DD>The old layer is made active, as shown by the Layers dialog in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize2">2.20</A>(b), and is deleted by clicking on the
trash can icon in the button bar.
</DL>
<P>
The result of resizing the layer smaller is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize3">2.21</A>.

<BR>
In Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize3">2.21</A>(a) the layer has been resized
smaller, which can be seen by the black-and-yellow dashed layer
boundary.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.resize3">2.21</A>(b) shows the resulting Layers
dialog.  The procedure, as described, allows the layer contents to be
carefully positioned within the resized layer.

<P>
Although there are good reasons to resize an <EM>image</EM> larger, it is
difficult to imagine a good reason for resizing a <EM>layer</EM> larger.
However, due probably to a rationale of symmetry, a layer can be
resized larger.  It should be noted that, as for layer scaling, the
GIMP does not allow a layer to be resized to dimensions larger than
the window boundaries of an image.  To resize a layer larger than the
current image boundaries, the image must first be resized to
accommodate it.

2.6.3 Flipping

The active layer can be flipped around its vertical or horizontal axes
with the <TT>Flip</TT><A NAME="2343">&#160;</A> tool from the Toolbox.  A flip is
performed by clicking on the <TT>Flip</TT> tool icon, represented by a

2.6.5 The Transform Tool
</H2>

<P>
General transformations of a layer can be done using the <TT>Transform</TT> tool from the Toolbox.  This tool can perform rotation,
scaling, shearing, and perspective transformations of the active
layer.  As usual, care must be taken to specify the active layer
before applying this tool.

illustrates an image layer contained in a somewhat larger window.
Shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1">2.24</A>(b) is the <TT>Tool Options</TT>
dialog, which is obtained by double-clicking the <TT>Transform</TT> tool
icon in the Toolbox window.  The four radio buttons in the Transform
area of the dialog are used to select the desired transformation type,
which can be Rotation, Scaling, Shearing, or Perspective.

<P>
Transforming a layer requires interpolation of pixel values, and
this can introduce some jagged-edge artifacts into the result.  The
toggle button labeled Smoothing diminishes this effect, which is why
it is on by default.  It does tend to make the image a little less
sharp, though (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node63.html#s6.unsharp-mask">6.4.1</A> for a discussion of
how to recover some of the lost sharpness).

<P>
The Tool paradigm area of the dialog has two options.  The default is
Traditional, which maps the image to a transformed grid (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-2">2.26</A>).  For those who like to go
against the grain, the Corrective option maps the transformed grid to
the image, thus producing an inverse transformation.  For example,
rotating the transform grid in one direction with the Corrective
option maps the grid back to the image, making the image itself rotate
in the opposite direction.  Sound complicated?  It isn't.  Just try it
yourself and you'll see.

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-1">2.25</A>(b) the <TT>Rotation
Information</TT><A NAME="2409">&#160;</A> dialog that appears
when the left mouse button is clicked in the image window.  The <TT>Rotation Information</TT> dialog has entry boxes that can be used to give
a specific angle of rotation as well as the position of the point that
will be the center of rotation.  By default, the center of rotation is
the geometric center of the active layer.

<P>
For each of the Transform options, Rotation, Scaling, Shearing, or
Perspective, the first mouse click on the image brings up a dialog
specific to the chosen option.  This mouse click also displays a
grid<A NAME="2411">&#160;</A> superimposed on the active
layer in the image window.  The number of grid lines can be controlled
from the <TT>Tool Options</TT> dialog (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1">2.24</A>(b)).  The grid lines can be seen in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-1">2.25</A>(c).  Placing the mouse cursor
within the active layer in the image window changes the cursor in
accordance with the type of transformation to be performed.  The image
outline and grid can then be transformed by clicking and dragging.
The transformation of the <EM>grid</EM> can be adjusted as many times as
desired because the transformation of the <EM>image</EM> is not initiated
until the option transform button is clicked.  For example, the Rotate
button in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-2">2.26</A>(b) must be clicked to
cause the actual rotation of the image.

<P>
As the grid is rotated for the Rotate option of the <TT>Transform</TT>
tool, the angle is interactively reported in the <TT>Rotation
Information</TT> dialog.  The rotated outline for an angle of 25<SUP><I>o</I></SUP> is
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-2">2.26</A>(a).  As already stated,
once the desired angle of rotation is found, the image itself is
rotated by clicking on the Rotate button, seen in the dialog shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-2">2.26</A>(b).  The resulting rotated layer
is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-2">2.26</A>(c).

<P>
As an alternative to interactively rotating the grid with the mouse,
the rotation can also be performed by entering a value into the Angle
entry box or by using the slider in the Rotation dialog.  Useful
values of rotation can be determined with the <TT>Measure</TT><A NAME="2424">&#160;</A> tool.  An example of this is illustrated
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node67.html#s7.compositing.proj2">7.2</A>.

illustrates the Scaling option of the <TT>Transform</TT> tool.  Like for
rotation, scaling can be performed interactively with the mouse or by
entering values into the Width and Height entry boxes in the Scaling
dialog.

<P>
Values can be entered into the Scaling dialog<A NAME="2436">&#160;</A> in
a number of units, the default being pixels.  It is often convenient
to perform scaling as a percentage of the original dimensions (which
are shown at the top of the Scaling dialog as the Original Width and
Height).  This can be done by choosing the % option from the
pull-down menu in the dialog.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-3">2.27</A>(b)
shows that this choice was used to scale the grid in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-3">2.27</A>(a) by 50% in both dimensions.
When the Scale button in the dialog is clicked, this produces the
result shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-3">2.27</A>(c).

<P>
It is useful to be able to constrain the X and Y scale ratio so as to
maintain their aspect ratio when scaling a layer with the <TT>Transform</TT> tool.  This is done by pressing both the Control and Alt
keys while using the mouse to scale the transform grid.  Useful values
for scaling can be determined using the <TT>Measure</TT><A NAME="2442">&#160;</A> tool.  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#s7.panoramas">7.5</A> illustrates an example of

<BR>
This is the only transform option where values cannot be directly
entered into a dialog.  As shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-5">2.29</A>(b), there is numerical feedback
about how the Perspective transform option is applied to the image,
but this is not particularly valuable because it is unclear how to
reuse the information.  The consequence is that the Perspective option
may only be applied interactively with the mouse.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-5">2.29</A>(a) shows that the grid line
feature provides very useful feedback for this particular tool.  The
lines help visualize the perspective warping that will take place once
the Transform button is clicked in the <TT>Perspective Transform</TT>
dialog.<A NAME="2469">&#160;</A>  The perspective transform
allows each of the four corners of the layer to be independently
repositioned.  The resulting image is warped to a general
quadrilateral.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-5">2.29</A>(c) shows the
result of applying the perspective transform specified by the grid
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#f.layers.transform1p2-5">2.29</A>(a).

<P>
It should be noted that all the transforms can be used in conjunction
with the Transform Lock<A NAME="2472">&#160;</A> option of the Paths
dialog.  This is extremely useful and is discussed in more detail in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#s3.path-palette">3.4.1</A>.  A relevant example is shown in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node67.html#s7.compositing.proj2">7.2</A>.
