Setting up Your Computer to Get the Most from the GIMP
</H1>

<P>
This section describes how to optimize the hardware and software
configuration of your computer to optimize the performance of the
GIMP.

<P>

Notes on RAM
</H2>

<P>
The GIMP executable is about 7 Mb; however, depending on the size of
the GIMP data directories (patterns, palettes, brushes, and so on),
the memory footprint can grow another 2-10 Mb.  In addition, the
script-fu program that runs concurrently with the GIMP occupies about
2.5 Mb.  Thus, the GIMP requires a minimum of about 11.5-19.5 Mb of
RAM.

<P>
This is not all, though, because every image loaded into the GIMP also
requires memory.  For example, loading an RGB format image will
require at least three times the number of pixels in the image (one
byte per RGB channel and perhaps a byte for the alpha channel) per
layer.  Thus, an image with dimensions 
<!-- MATH: $640\times 480$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.gif"
 ALT="$640\times 480$">
pixels
containing three equal-sized layers requires from 2.8 to 3.7 Mb of
memory.

<P>
In addition to the memory required to display the image, there is also
the memory required for the undo cache.  This is what
allows the GIMP to undo operations to an image being worked on.

<P>
The conclusion is that to work comfortably in the GIMP--to be able to
open images, composite, touchup, and apply filters--32 Mb of memory
should be considered a minimum.  Of course, the RAM required will be
proportionally more for large images containing multiple layers.

<P>

Notes on Video RAM
</H2>

<P>
The ability to display large images on a video monitor depends on the
amount of video RAM available on the video card.  For example, if the
display resolution is 
<!-- MATH: $1024\times 768$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$1024\times 768$">
with only 8 bits<A NAME="387">&#160;</A> (1 byte) of color per pixel, the minimum required amount of
video RAM is 0.79 Mb.  However, working with only 8 bits per pixel is
paltry, because it only allows for 256 simultaneous colors on the
screen at one time.

<P>
Increasing the color depth to 16 bits<A NAME="388">&#160;</A> (2 bytes) at
a resolution of 
<!-- MATH: $1024\times 768$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$1024\times 768$">
doubles the required video RAM to
1.57 Mb.  This is really the minimum video RAM required to get
reasonable performance from the GIMP, and a higher-performance system
might have a resolution of 
<!-- MATH: $1600\times 1200$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.gif"
 ALT="$1600\times 1200$">
with 24 bits<A NAME="389">&#160;</A> (3 bytes) of color per pixel, requiring at least 5.76 Mb of
video RAM.

Notes on Swap and GIMP Memory Management</A>
</H2>

<P>
The GIMP uses memory as specified by the <TT>Toolbox:File/Preferences</TT>
dialog.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node12.html#f.readme.swap">4</A>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.readme.swap">&#160;</A><A NAME="394">&#160;</A>

shows the Environment Settings branch of the <TT>Preferences</TT>
dialog. As seen in the figure, the associated entry box for the tile
cache<A NAME="399">&#160;</A><A NAME="400">&#160;</A> size has the default value of 10 Mb.
The cache is a piece of RAM that the GIMP reserves for caching the
images you are working on.  If you are working with large images or
with many medium-sized ones, you can easily exceed this cache size.
Under these circumstances, the additional required memory is obtained
by creating a GIMP swap file in the user's <TT>.gimp</TT> directory.
Since this memory is not necessarily located in RAM, this can
significantly diminish the performance of the GIMP.  Thus, if the user
has good RAM resources and is working with large images, it makes
sense to increase the 10 Mb value of the cache.

<P>
For example, with 128 Mb of RAM and with the GIMP running as the
primary application, perhaps a reasonable size for the cache is 50 to
75 Mb.  This number can be tuned to the user's needs.  A useful tool
for determining how much memory is required by your applications is
the Linux/Unix command, <TT>top</TT>.  This command dynamically shows
many of the characteristics of running processes on your machine.  In
particular, the column <TT>%MEM</TT> gives the percentage memory used by
each process.  Typing <TT>S-m</TT> (i.e., an uppercase M) makes <TT>top</TT>
display the processes sorted by memory use.  The following is a
truncated output from <TT>top</TT> on my Linux machine after sorting by
memory use:

As can be seen from the display, there is 128 Mb of RAM, of which GIMP
is occupying 11.6%.  In conjunction with the other processes,
including X, Netscape, and Emacs, about 50% of the RAM is being used.
The remaining 50% equals 64 Mb of RAM.  Thus, for my machine, it
might be reasonable to set the GIMP cache to 50 Mb.  Of course, your
mileage will vary.

Loading Fonts
</H2>

<P>
The <TT>Text</TT><A NAME="418">&#160;</A> tool in the GIMP requires fonts served
up by the X Window System.  Unfortunately, not every X Window System
is delivered with all the cool fonts you'll want to have.  It is
possible, though, to download a nice set of fonts from the Internet
and to install them on your system.  This section describes how to do
that.  Note that although the advice given here will work on many
Linux and UNIX systems, it is not guaranteed to work on all of them.
The goal of this section is to be helpful, but due to the variability
of different systems, it would be impossible to cover all cases.

<P>
There are two widely used font collections for computers running the X
Window System.  These collections are called <TT>freefonts</TT><A NAME="420">&#160;</A> and <TT>sharefonts</TT>.<A NAME="422">&#160;</A>  They can be found at many
places around the web, but two places you might try are:<PRE>
 ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/fonts/
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/X11/fonts/
</PRE>
The files to download will be named something like <TT>freefonts-0.10.tar.gz</TT> and <TT>sharefonts-0.10.tar.gz</TT>.  The names
may change to reflect updated version numbers.

<P>
Once downloaded, they must be installed in a font directory.  For
RedHat Linux systems, fonts are typically installed in <TT>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/</TT>.  However, this may be different for other
systems running the X Window System.  It is not necessary to install
the fonts in the system directory.  They can be installed anywhere
that is convenient--even in the user's home directory.  This last
option may be necessary for a user who wants to use great fonts but
doesn't have root privilege.

<P>
The following instructions assume that the installation is being made
to the user's directory called <TT>~/FONTS</TT>.  After downloading
the two font packages and moving them to this directory, the
instructions for installing the <TT>freefonts</TT> package are as
follows: <PRE>
% cd ~/FONTS
% gzip -dc freefonts-0.10.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE> 
This uncompresses and unpacks the font collection archive.  This is
followed by the commands that tell the X Window System where the new
fonts live: <PRE>
% xset fp+ ~/FONTS/freefont
% xset fp rehash
</PRE>
Follow the same instructions to install the <TT>sharefonts</TT> package
and that's all there is to it!  The <TT>freefonts</TT> package contains
79 fonts and the <TT>sharefonts</TT> package 22.  The next time the GIMP
is run, these new fonts will be available to the <TT>Text</TT> tool.

<P>
If these fonts were not pre-installed in the usual system directory,
you'll need to tell the X Window System where to find them each time you
start up a new X session.  This can be automated by putting the
last two commands above in your <TT>.xinitrc</TT> file.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00845000000000000000">
Setting the X Window System to Run More Than 8 bpp</A>
</H2>

<P>
Using the GIMP is greatly enhanced by having a display with sufficient
color depth<A NAME="440">&#160;</A> to display
subtle color variations.  A display with only 8 bits per pixel (bpp)
can represent only 256 colors simultaneously, which is insufficient
for many photographs.  The result, as explained in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#s9.color-distortion">9.5.1</A>, is a type of color distortion
called dithering.
 
If your video adapter has sufficient RAM, it is possible to display at
16 or 24 bits per pixel, which will greatly enhance your viewing
pleasure and your ability to work effectively with color.  For
example, to run at 16 bits per pixel at a 
<!-- MATH: $1024\times 768$ -->

 ALT="$1024\times 768$">
screen
resolution, you'll need about 1.6 Mb of video RAM.  However, at a
resolution of 
<!-- MATH: $800\times 600$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img15.gif"
 ALT="$800\times 600$">,
you'll need less than 1 Mb.  Whether it
is reasonable to use the lower resolution to get better color depth is
up to the individual user to decide.

<P>
The X Window System on Linux machines typically defaults to only 8
bpp.  If you are using XFree86, the following command can be used to
run a higher color depth (for other X Window Systems, consult your man
pages):<PRE>
 
% startx -- -bpp 16
</PRE>
This command will run X at 16 bpp only if there is an appropriate
section in the XF86Config file.  For Redhat Linux systems, this file
is typically found in the directory <TT>/etc</TT> or <TT>/etc/X11</TT>.
More details on how to configure the X Window System using XF86Config
can be found in the XF86Config man page.
