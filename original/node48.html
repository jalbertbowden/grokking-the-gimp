4.6 Common Problems and <BR>
Frequently Asked Questions
</H1>

<P>
Masks can be tricky and, as with layers, it is sometimes possible to
run into seemingly incomprehensible difficulties.  The reason is
almost always because the active layer is not what you think it is.
The following lists some common problems you might run into with
masks.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>I just saved a selection to a channel mask, and I can't modify
certain parts of the mask.  Why not?</B>

<P>
The problem is that the selection is still active.  This means that
modifications to the mask are allowed only in the selected region.
Cancel the selection using <TT>Image:Select/None</TT> or by typing <TT>C-S-a</TT> in the image window.

<P>
<LI><B>I just saved a selection to a channel mask, and I can no longer
paint or filter my image.  What's wrong?</B>

<P>
Saving a selection to a channel automatically makes the new channel
mask the active layer; however, if you check the Channels dialog,
you'll see that the active channel is not visible.  Thus, the paint
and filtering operations you are trying to use have been applied to
the channel mask, which can't be seen.  Either toggle on the channel
mask visibility by clicking on its Eye icon in the Channels dialog, or
make the desired image layer active in the Layers dialog.

<P>
<LI><B>I try cutting a selection in a mask or channel, and nothing
happens.  What's going on?</B>

<P>
Cutting a selection in a mask has the effect of making the selected
mask pixels the background color (as shown by the <TT>Active
Background Color</TT> patch in the Toolbox).  If the selection is made in
a black part of the mask, make the background color white.  If it is
made in a white part of the mask, change the background to black.
Typing <TT>d</TT><A NAME="5985">&#160;</A> in the image window sets the
default colors, which are black for the <TT>Active Foreground Color</TT>
and white for the <TT>Active Background Color</TT>.  Typing <TT>x</TT>
switches the foreground and background colors.

<P>
<LI><B>I try painting in a layer mask, but the associated image doesn't
become transparent/opaque where I painted. I only get paint marks on
the image.  Why?</B><A NAME="5990">&#160;</A>

<P>
The layer mask is not active.  Make sure you select it by clicking on
its thumbnail in the Layers dialog.

<P>
<LI><B>I am trying to use the paint tools, but the results are strange.
Sometimes I don't get the color indicated by the <TT>Active
Foreground Color</TT> patch, and other times I don't get anything at all.
Is my GIMP broken?</B>

<P>
No, the GIMP is not broken.  Check the Mode menu in the <TT>Brush
Selection</TT> dialog.  If the blend mode is not set to <TT>Normal</TT>, this
explains your problem.
