3.2 Combining Selections
</H1>

<P>
Selections can be combined in various ways.  In particular, the GIMP
provides the capability to add, subtract, and intersect selections.

3.2.1 Adding
</H2>

<P>
Adding a selection to an existing one means that the resulting
selection is the union of the pixels from the two.  Thus, if <I>A</I> is
the set of pixels defined by the first selection and <I>B</I> the set for
the second, then <IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img80.gif"
 ALT="$A\cup B$">
is the result of adding the second to the
first, where <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img81.gif"
 ALT="$\cup$">
is the set union operator.

<P>
If a selection already exists in the image window, the addition is
made by pressing the Shift key <EM>before</EM> clicking to begin the
new selection.  Once the mouse button has been pressed, the Shift
key should be released.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#f.selections.combine">3.15</A>(a) shows an
initial rectangular selection, and Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#f.selections.combine">3.15</A>(b)
shows the result of adding an ellipse to this.

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
It is useful to note that pressing the Shift key while the mouse is
in the image window has the effect of changing the mouse cursor to an
arrow with a plus sign below it.  This indicates that the next
selection will be added to any selection already existing in the image
window.

3.2.2 Subtracting
</H2>

<P>
Subtracting a new selection from an existing one means that the result
is the first selection less the pixels contained in the intersection
of the two.  Thus, if <I>A</I> is the set of pixels defined by the first
selection and <I>B</I> is the set for the second, 
<!-- MATH: $A-(A\cap B)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="40" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img83.gif"
 ALT="$A-(A\cap B)$">
is the
result of subtracting the second from the first, where <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img84.gif"
 ALT="$\cap$">
is the
set intersection operator.

<P>
A subtraction is made by pressing the Control key <EM>before</EM>
beginning the new selection.  Once the new selection is begun, the
Control key should be released.  The result of subtracting an ellipse
from the rectangular selection in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#f.selections.combine">3.15</A>(a)
is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#f.selections.combine">3.15</A>(c).  Note that it is the
new selection that is subtracted from the old selection, not vice
versa.

<P>
It is useful to note that pressing the Control key while the mouse is
in the image window has the effect of changing the mouse cursor to an
arrow with a minus sign below it.  This indicates that the next
selection will be subtracted from any selection already existing in
the image window.  Because I always forget which key controls addition
and which controls subtraction, I find the mouse cursor indicators are
particularly useful.

<BR>
3.2.3 Intersecting
</H2>

<P>
Intersecting two selections means that the resulting selection is, you
guessed it, the intersection of the two.  Thus, if <I>A</I> is the set of
pixels defined by the first selection and <I>B</I> the set for the second,
<IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img85.gif"
 ALT="$A\cap B$">
is the result of intersecting the two.  The intersection is
made by pressing the Shift and Control keys together <EM>before</EM>
pressing the left mouse button to begin the new selection.  The
Control and Shift keys should be released before releasing the mouse
button.  The result of intersecting an ellipse with the rectangular
selection in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#f.selections.combine">3.15</A>(a) is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#f.selections.combine">3.15</A>(d).

<P>
It is useful to note that pressing the Shift and Control keys
together while the mouse is in the image window has the effect of
changing the mouse cursor to an arrow with a <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img84.gif"
 ALT="$\cap$">
sign below
it.  This indicates that the next selection will be intersected with
any selection already existing in the image window.

<P>

3.2.4 Using Add, Subtract, and Intersect with the Rectangle
and Ellipse Selection Tool Features
</H2>

<P>
As described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3.rectangle-ellipse-select">3.1.1</A>, the Shift
key can be used to create perfectly square or circular selections, and
the Control key can be used to perform selections centered at the
position of the mouse click.  In addition,
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#s3-2.combining-selections">3.2</A> describes how the Shift
key can be used for adding selections, the Control key for subtracting
them, and the Shift and Control keys together for intersecting them.

<P>
The question you may be asking, then, is how these features can be
used together.  How can a perfect square be subtracted from a prior
selection or a center-initiated ellipse added to one?  The answer is
quite simple.  The trick is to remember that adding, subtracting, and
intersecting selections is signaled by pressing the Shift key, the
Control key, or both <EM>before</EM> clicking to initiate the selection.
The sequence for creating a perfectly square or circular selection or
for center-initiated selections is by pressing the Shift key, Control
key, or both <EM>after</EM> clicking to initiate the selection.  These
features can be combined by applying the following steps:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Begin by pressing the appropriate combination of Shift and
Control to specify whether the selection is to be added to,
subtracted from, or intersected with an already existing selection.
<DT>2.
<DD>While the keys are pressed, click and drag in the
image window to initiate the new selection.
<DT>3.
<DD>While the left mouse button is pressed, release the Shift
and/or Control keys.
<DT>4.
<DD>Apply the appropriate combination of Shift and Control keys to
specify a perfectly square, circular, and/or center-initiated
selection.
<DT>5.
<DD>While keeping the last combination of Shift and Control keys
pressed, release the mouse button, thus completing the selection.
</DL>

3.2.5 Moving a Selection Boundary
</H2>

<P>
Occasionally it is useful to be able to move a selection after it has
been made.  That is, it is useful moving the selection itself, not the
selection contents.  This can be done by Alt-clicking and dragging the
selection boundary.
