3.1 The Basic Selection Tools
</H1>

<P>
There are two types<A NAME="3338">&#160;</A> of selection tools.
The first type works by drawing lines that separate the selection
subject from its background.  The second type makes a selection by
specifying a representative <EM>seed</EM> pixel from the subject.  The
selection is then made automatically by including other pixels in the
image that are sufficiently similar to the seed in color.

<P>
A goal of this chapter is to explain how to decide which type of
selection tool should be applied.  Often it is some combination that
is the most effective.  The decision is partially based on evaluating
the characteristics of the subject that best differentiate it from the
background.  These could be a combination of its color, shape, value,
or saturation (for more on the characteristics of color, value, and
saturation, see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#c5.colorspaces">5</A>).  For difficult
selections it is often necessary to experiment in order to discover
the most effective approach.

3.1.1 The Six Selection Tools from the Toolbox</A>
</H2>

<P>
In this section we start to develop our skills by reviewing the GIMP's
basic selection tools and by exploring their underlying strengths and
weaknesses.  To begin, we discuss the six selection tools found in the
GIMP Toolbox, shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.toolbox">3.1</A>.  They
consist of the <TT>Rectangle Select</TT>,

the <TT>Ellipse Select</TT>, the <TT>Free-Hand Select</TT> (also known as
the <TT>Lasso</TT>), the <TT>Fuzzy Select</TT> (known as the <TT>Magic
Wand</TT>), the <TT>Bezier Path</TT> tool, and the <TT>Intelligent
Scissors</TT>.  Of these, the <TT>Bezier Path</TT> and the <TT>Lasso</TT> are
the most useful.  <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> is also of some use.  Of less
use are the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> and <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> tools.  Finally,
although the <TT>Intelligent Scissors</TT><A NAME="3362">&#160;</A>
has an intriguing name, there is nothing this tool can do that can't
be done better and more efficiently using other tools.

3.1.1.1 The <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> and <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> Tools
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> and <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> tools are used for
selecting rectangular and elliptical regions in an image.  A selection
is initiated by clicking and dragging in the image window, and the
selection is completed by releasing the mouse button.  The selection
process is interactively facilitated by an outline of the selection
that can be seen while the mouse is being dragged.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.marquees1">3.2</A> shows examples of both the 
<TT>Rectangle Select</TT> and <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> tools.

<BR>
When completed, selections are displayed as moving dashed lines,
traditionally referred to as the <EM>Marching Ants</EM>.<A NAME="3380">&#160;</A><A NAME="3381">&#160;</A>  In the figure,
the arrows are just for illustrating where the selections begin and
end.  They don't actually appear when you use these tools.  The
arrows' tails show where the selections were initiated, and the heads
show where they were terminated.  Note that for the <TT>Ellipse
Select</TT> tool the selection is inscribed in a rectangle defined by the
arrow's head and tail.

<P>
A perfectly square selection<A NAME="3383">&#160;</A> can be made with
the <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> tool, and a perfectly
circular<A NAME="3385">&#160;</A> selection can be made with the
<TT>Ellipse Select</TT> tool.  The trick is to use the Shift key, but
read on carefully.  Two other selection tricks are also performed with
the Shift key (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#s3-2.combining-selections">3.2</A> for the
other).  To avoid confusion, it is important to pay close attention to
how this works.

<P>
To obtain a perfectly square or circular selection, begin the
selection by clicking and dragging in the image window.  While the
mouse button is down, press the Shift key.  In the image window,
the resulting selection shape becomes a perfectly square or circular,
depending on the tool you are using.  The Shift key must remain
pressed until the selection is finished and the mouse button has been
released.  Only then may the Shift key be released.  If the Shift key
is released before the left mouse button, the selection will revert to
a normal rectangle or ellipse selection.  The results of using the
Shift key with the <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> and <TT>Ellipse Select</TT>
tools are illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.marquees2">3.3</A>.

<P>
Instead of initiating a rectangular or elliptical selection at one
corner and terminating at the opposite one, it is also possible to
initiate from the selection's center, terminating at a corner.  The
trick for this is similar to the technique just described for creating
a perfectly square or circular selection.  It is done by pressing the
Control key after initiating the selection with the left mouse button.
The Control key must remain pressed until after the mouse button is
released.  To combine perfectly square or circular selections in
conjunction with center initiated ones, the Shift and Control keys
must both be pressed after the left mouse button is clicked and remain
so until after the mouse button is released.

3.1.1.2 The <TT>Lasso</TT> (the <TT>Free-Hand Selection</TT> Tool)
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Lasso</TT> is used to draw free-hand selections.  Although its
official name is the <TT>Free-Hand Selection</TT> tool, the <TT>Lasso</TT>
will be preferred in this book because the tool's icon in the Toolbox
resembles a lasso (and it's also a lot shorter to type).

<P>
The <TT>Lasso</TT> is used by clicking and dragging in the image window,
tracing out the shape to be selected.  Releasing the mouse button
completes the selection.  While tracing with the <TT>Lasso</TT>, the
outline of the selection can be seen, and, when completed, the
selection is shown by the Marching Ants.

<BR>
shows an example of a <TT>Lasso</TT> selection.  

<P>
The advantage of the <TT>Lasso</TT> is that it can be used to select
arbitrarily complex objects.  The disadvantage is that the work can be
painstakingly slow, requiring extremely fine control of the mouse.
Even the small selection shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.lasso">3.4</A> was
difficult, because the tree's outline is so jagged and rough.  Another
aspect of the <TT>Lasso</TT> that makes it difficult for precision work
is that the mouse button cannot be released while the selection is
being made.  This precludes using this tool for making large,
complicated selections.  For these reasons, the <TT>Lasso</TT> will not
be our selection tool of choice for fine-grain work.  Rather, it will
mainly be used to rough-out selections around complicated shapes or
for completing work on masks.  A good example of the latter use of the
<TT>Lasso</TT> is demonstrated in Sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#s4.threshold">4.5.3</A> and
<A HREF="node69.html#s7.compositing.proj4">7.4</A>.

3.1.1.3 The <TT>Magic Wand</TT> (the <TT>Fuzzy Select</TT> Tool)
</H3>

<P>
Although its name is officially the <TT>Fuzzy Select</TT> tool, the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> will be preferred in this book because the tool's icon, as
shown in the Toolbox, resembles a magic wand.  The <TT>Magic Wand</TT>
makes selections based on specifying a seed pixel in the image.  The
seed is the first selected pixel, and the pixels directly adjoining
the seed are included in the selection if their colors are
sufficiently close to the color of the seed.  This creates a second
set of selected pixels.  This process is repeated with the neighboring
pixels of the second selected set, and so on, until no more pixels can
be added.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.magic-wand">3.5</A> illustrates how the <TT>Magic
Wand</TT> works.

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.magic-wand">3.5</A>(a) shows a smoothly-varying,
radial gradient of pixel values going from black at the center to
white at the edges.  The location where the seed was chosen with the
mouse is indicated.  The resulting ring-like region selected by the
<TT>Magic Wand</TT> is shown by the Marching Ants.  The ring selection is
equally thick on both sides of the seed because the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>
includes pixels that have both higher and lower color values than the
seed's.

<P>
So, how much lower and higher can adjoining pixel colors be and still
be included in the selection?  This is specified by the <TT>Magic
Wand</TT>'s selection threshold, which, as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.magic-wand">3.5</A>(b), can be set with the Threshold
slider in the <TT>Tool Options</TT> dialog<A NAME="3441">&#160;</A>
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3-5.tool-options">3.1.2</A> for more on this).  It can also
be set interactively with the mouse.  The threshold is set
interactively by keeping the left mouse button pressed when selecting
the seed pixel.  When the outline of the selection appears, and with
the left mouse button continually pressed, the mouse can be moved
either to the right (or downward) to increase the threshold or to the
left (or upward) to diminish it.  Increasing the threshold results in
a larger selection, and decreasing it, a smaller one.  Changing the
threshold should be done by moving the mouse in small increments so
that the changes in the selected region can be carefully controlled.

<P>
The <TT>Magic Wand</TT> is a conceptually attractive tool.  In principle,
it automatically makes the selection by grouping pixels that are
similar in color and that are spatially connected, being grown from a
seed pixel.  In practice, however, it is often difficult to get good
results with the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>.  This is because it is hard to find
the seed pixel and threshold pair that will produce the selection we
want.  As an example, imagine a subject you want to select using the
<TT>Magic Wand</TT> and that has pixel color values ranging from <I>X</I> to
<I>Y</I>.  To make the selection with the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>, a pixel whose
value is exactly midway between <I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> must be selected as the
seed.  But how do we determine what <I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> are for our subject,
and how do we find the pixel in the subject that has the midway value?
These practical problems are not easily solved!

<P>
Fortunately there is another tool in the GIMP that allows you to more
easily exploit the color-grouping selection concept.  This tool is
called <TT>Threshold</TT> and is found in the <TT>Image:Image/Colors</TT>
menu.  Its use is presented in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#s4.threshold">4.5.3</A>.

3.1.1.4 Bezier Paths
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>Bezier Path</TT> selection tool is very powerful.  It is the only
selection tool that allows the interactive adjustment of the
selections it makes.  The <TT>Bezier Path</TT> tool works by placing <EM>control points</EM><A NAME="3456">&#160;</A> on an image.  These are
initially connected by straight-line <EM>path segments</EM>; however,
using the <EM>control handles</EM><A NAME="3459">&#160;</A> hidden inside each control point, the path segments can be made
to curve in practically arbitrary manners.  By using a Bezier path, an
initial selection can be interactively corrected until the final
result fits the desired selection like a glove.

<TR><TD><IMG
 SRC="img71.gif"
ALT="Figure 3.6"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
illustrates the basic operations of a Bezier path.  The initial Bezier
path shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-control">3.6</A>(a) was created
by clicking in the image window five times.  The upper-left corner was
the first point, and the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right
corners were the second, third, and fourth points added to the path.
The final click of the mouse was made on the initial point, thus
closing the path.  As each point was added, the straight-line segments
seen in the figure appeared between the control points.

<P>
While constructing a Bezier path, the mouse cursor appears as an arrow,
with a filled circle just below and slightly to the arrow's right.
This circle indicates that the path is not closed and that the
next mouse click will create a new control point.  Note that Bezier
paths need not be closed.  This is discussed in more detail in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#s3.paths-dialog">3.4</A>, which describes the Paths dialog.

<P>
The path segments between control points can be made to curve by
manipulating the points' control handles.  For a closed Bezier path,
the control handles are made visible by clicking on a control point
and dragging. 
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-control">3.6</A>(b) shows how the control
handles for the upper-left corner of the Bezier path have been pulled
out of that control point.  The dragging action of the mouse positions
one of the control handles while the other moves in tandem with, but
diametrically opposite, the first.  As can be seen in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-control">3.6</A>(b), the two path segments
attached to the control point are made to curve by the action of the
control handles.

<P>
Note that the control handles do not disappear once the mouse button
has been released and that the handles can be readjusted at any time
by clicking the mouse on either handle and dragging.  However, only
one set of handles may be visible at once.  Clicking on another
control point displays its handles while toggling off the visibility
of the handles for any other point.  Also note that when the mouse
cursor is close enough to a control point or control handle to
manipulate it, the cursor changes from an arrow with a filled circle
below it to an arrow with the outline of square.  Because control
handles resemble squares, this special cursor is a useful way to
indicate that the mouse cursor is close enough to the control point
for the handles to be active.

<P>
The two control handles for a point can be moved independently of each
other by using the Shift key.  Pressing the Shift key while dragging
a handle with the mouse makes that handle move while the other remains
stationary.  Moving a single control handle in this way allows the
curvature of a single path segment to be manipulated.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-control">3.6</A>(c) shows the result of using
the Shift key to move one of the control handles independently of the
other.  Note how this changes the curve of the upper segment of the
square while leaving the curve of the left segment as it was.

<P>
It is also possible to reposition a control point.  This is done by
pressing the Control key before clicking on a control point.
Dragging the mouse while the mouse button and Control key are
pressed moves the control point.  The result of repositioning a
control point is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-control">3.6</A>(d).

<P>
After creating a Bezier path with all the control points properly
positioned and all the path segments appropriately curved, it may then
be converted to a selection.  This is done by clicking inside the
closed path.  Note that when the mouse cursor is moved inside the
closed path, the cursor changes to an arrow with the outline of a
dashed rectangle below it.  The dashed rectangle resembles the
Marching Ants, which will appear when the Bezier path is converted to a
selection.

been created by placing seven control points around the perimeter of a
sea turtle's shell.  Although the points are all positioned on the
edge of the shell, the straight-line segments between points do not
marry well to the shell's shape.

As just described, the Bezier path can be adjusted to the shell's

The two handles had to be adjusted independently of each other to
properly match the curve of the shell on either side of the control
point.  This can be seen in the figure by the different lengths of the
control handles and by the slight angle between them.

<P>
After adjusting the control handles for each point in the Bezier path
it is converted to a selection.  The result, showing the Marching
Ants, is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier3">3.9</A>.

<BR>
What is particularly interesting about this example is that the
selection has been made with only a few control points.  This is a
strength of this tool.  However, there are limitations to what can be
accomplished with a Bezier path.  A very irregular shape will need
many control points and will require a lot of work to adjust the path
to the shape.

<P>
A practical question is where should the control points be placed?
Another is how many control points are necessary to adequately select
a shape?  For the placement of control points here are some rules of
thumb:
<UL>
<LI>A control point must always be placed at a corner (like the one
found at the rear-most point of the sea turtle's shell in
Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier1">3.7</A> through
<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier3">3.9</A>).
<LI>A straight-edge region can only be created by placing a
control point at each end of the edge, as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-number">3.10</A>(a).
<LI>An inflection point on a curve can be created between a pair
of control points, as shown in the bottom path segment of
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-number">3.10</A>(b).  It can also be created
with a single control point if this is placed exactly at the point of
inflection.

</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
The number of control points needed to adequately adjust a Bezier path
to a shape is a more difficult question.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier-number">3.10</A>(c) shows that a pair of
control points are all that is needed to create a circle.  Thus, a
single control point can cover up to 180 degrees of curve.  However,
this doesn't account for all curve characteristics.  I personally like
to place control points as the shape of my selection passes through 90
degrees of curve.  This personal rule is borne out in the sea turtle
selection shown in Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.bezier1">3.7</A>.  

<P>
In any case, the issue of the number of points required for a shape is
not critical because it can be resolved using the Add Point and Delete
Point functions available in the Paths dialog.  These are discussed in
detail in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#s3.paths-dialog">3.4</A>.

In principle the <TT>Intelligent Scissors</TT> is supposed to work by
following, as closely as possible, constant-valued color contours in
the image between subsequent points clicked by the mouse.  However, at
the time of this writing, the <TT>Intelligent Scissors</TT> is a GIMP
tool that seems to be broken.  Much perplexed discussion has passed
through the GIMP developers' mailing list on this tool and,
unfortunately, it seems that for the present this tool has little or
no value.  Even if the tool did work, I would still rank it as a tool
of little utility.

3.1.2.1 Antialiasing
</H3>

<P>
Antialiasing is an important edge treatment for selections.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.selections.anti-alias">&#160;</A><A NAME="3521">&#160;</A>

How Antialiasing Works</CAPTION>
<TR><TD><IMG
 SRC="img76.gif"
ALT="Figure 3.11"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
illustrates the antialiasing concept.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A>(a) shows an array of pixels that
has been partitioned into two regions by a selection edge.  However,
due to the slope of the selection and the finite area of the pixels,
some pixels are on both sides of the selection edge.  That is, these
pixels are only partially selected.  What happens to this set of
partially selected pixels is important for the aesthetic presentation
of the selection's edge.

<P>
For example, let's assume that white represents a selected pixel and
black an unselected one.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A>(b)
shows what happens if pixels are included in the selection when more
than 50% of the pixel is above the selection edge and unselected
otherwise.  This seems like a reasonable criterion, however, notice
that the selection edge obtained by applying this rule produces a
staircase effect on the edge.  This staircase effect, known as <EM>aliasing</EM>,<A NAME="3528">&#160;</A> makes the edge look harsh.  We'll see this
in a more realistic example in a moment.

<P>
Alternatively, Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A>(c) illustrates the
concept of antialiasing.  Here white represents a pixel which is fully
selected, black one that is fully unselected, and gray represents
partially selected pixels, where the level of gray indicates the
percentage of the pixel that falls inside the selection.  Thus, a
lighter value of gray indicates a more fully selected pixel and a
darker value a less selected one.  Assigning gray values to partially
selected pixels has the effect of visually smoothing the staircase
effect illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A>(b), which
is why this is called antialiasing.

<P>
The way antialiasing is actually implemented is by using the layer's
alpha channel.<A NAME="3531">&#160;</A>  Alpha channels
were introduced in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#s2.channels-layers">2.2</A> and a more
comprehensive presentation of them is given in Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node42.html#c4.masks">4</A>
and <A HREF="node49.html#c5.colorspaces">5</A>.  However, for the purposes of discussing
antialiasing it is sufficient to know that the white pixels in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A>(c) represent pixels that are
fully opaque, the black pixels those that are fully transparent, and
the gray pixels those that are partially opaque (or transparent).

illustrates a more realistic example of aliased and antialiased
pixels.  Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(a) and (b) each show a
circle created using the <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> tool.  For both, the
selections were filled with black using the <TT>Bucket
Fill</TT><A NAME="3545">&#160;</A> tool.  The selection made in part (a) of
the figure was made without antialiasing, and that in part (b) with.
From these two figures it can immediately be seen that the antialiased
circle seems to have a much smoother edge.

<P>
Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(c) and (d) show zoomed versions
of Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(a) and (b).  The staircase
effect can be clearly seen in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(c).  Alternatively, in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(d) there are black, edge pixels
that are partially transparent and that allow part of the yellow
background to show through.  Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(b)
and (d) demonstrate that antialiasing really does improve the
aesthetic appearance of the selection edge.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(e) shows that the Antialiasing
checkbox in the <TT>Tool Options</TT> dialog for the <TT>Ellipse Select</TT>
tool is toggled on for Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias2">3.12</A>(b) and
(d).  For all the selection tools, Antialiasing is on by default.

<P>
As a final remark, note that the <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> tool does not
have an antialiasing option.  This is normal because this selection tool
can never produce sloping edges.  Consequently, the staircase problem
illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.anti-alias">3.11</A> can never occur,
and antialiasing is not needed.

3.1.2.2 Feathering
</H3>

<P>
Feathering is a selection edge treatment similar to antialiasing.  It
works by changing the alpha value of pixels as a function of their
radial distance from the selection edge.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.feather1">3.13</A>

illustrates an example of a feathered selection.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.feather1">3.13</A>(a) shows how two guides have been
placed to aid in framing a selection using the <TT>Ellipse Select</TT>
tool.  

<P>
As shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.feather1">3.13</A>(b), a value of 40 has
been chosen for the Feather Radius in the <TT>Tool Options</TT> dialog
for this selection tool.  Furthermore, Antialiasing has been turned
off.  The result of inverting the selection and cutting away the
background is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.feather1">3.13</A>(c).  This
result is actually displayed on a yellow background so that the
transparency of the flower pixels can be better seen.  Also,
superimposed on Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.feather1">3.13</A>(c) is the original
elliptical selection.

<P>
The transparency of the flower image shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.feather1">3.13</A>(c) is 50% at the selection edge.
The transparency increases moving outward from the edge and decreases
moving inward from it.  The rate at which the transparency changes
while moving away from the selection edge is determined by the Feather
Radius.  For this example, the value chosen is 40, meaning that there
is a feathering effect up to 40 pixels away in both directions from
the selection edge.  Note that for all the selection tools, feathering
is off by default.

<P>
Partially selected pixels are discussed again in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#s4.partially-selected">4.1.7</A>.

3.1.2.3 Sample Merged
</H3>

<P>
Normally the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> selection tool only operates on the
pixel values in the active layer.  However, if this layer is not fully
opaque, or if this layer is using a blending mode (see
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node49.html#c5.colorspaces">5</A>), some of the pixel values from lower
layers affect the color in the active layer.  The Sample Merged option
in the <TT>Tool Options</TT> dialog for the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> takes this
into account.  When this option is on, it is the merged color values
of pixels that are used in the comparison algorithm for the <TT>Magic
Wand</TT>.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.magic-wand-options">3.14</A>

3.1.2.4 Threshold
</H3>

<P>
As described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3.magic-wand">3.1.1</A>, the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> uses
a search algorithm based on the color of a seed pixel and a specified
threshold value.  All contiguous pixels that have color values that
are less than the threshold from the seed are included in the
selection.  As already described, the Threshold can be set
interactively.  However, it can also be specified in the <TT>Magic
Wand</TT>'s <TT>Tool Options</TT> dialog.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#f.selections.magic-wand-options">3.14</A> illustrates the Threshold
slider which can take values from 0 to 255.
