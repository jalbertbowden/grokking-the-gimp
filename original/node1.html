guidelines described at
<A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="http://www.opencontent.org" target="new"><TT>http://www.opencontent.org</TT></A>.  The
following is the text of the license as it applies to this work:

<P><PRE>
I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS

This book ``Grokking the GIMP'' may be reproduced and distributed in
whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that
the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
incorporation of it by reference is displayed in the reproduction.

Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:

  Copyright (c) 2000 New Riders Publishing.  This material may be
  distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
  the Open Publication License, v1.0 or later (the latest version is
  presently available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).

The reference must be immediately followed with the elected options
(see section VI).

Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
permitted.

II. COPYRIGHT

The copyright is owned by New Riders Publishing.

III. SCOPE OF LICENSE

Mere aggregation of this work or a portion of this work with other
works or programs on the same media shall not cause this license to
apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice
specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and
appropriate copyright notice.

SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in
force.

NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is"
without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.

IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS

All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must
meet the following requirements:

1) The modified version must be labeled as such.

2) The person making the modifications must be identified and the 
   modifications dated.

3) Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable 
   must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.

4) The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.

5) The original author's name may not be used to assert or imply
   endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's
   (or authors') permission.

V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS 

In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
and strongly recommended of redistributors that:

1) If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or
   CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your
   intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript
   or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated
   documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any,
   made to the document.

2) All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either
   clearly marked up in the document or else described in an
   attachment to the document.

Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM
expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author.

VI. ELECTED OPTIONS

1) Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is
   prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.

2) Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard
   (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained
   from the copyright holder.  Other forms of distribution including
   CD-ROM, electronic, and magnetic media are permitted.
