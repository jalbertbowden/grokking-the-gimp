6.5 A Case Study
</H1>

<P>
This chapter has covered many elements of photo touchup and
enhancement.  To put all the elements into perspective, this section
presents a case study to illustrate the work flow of a typical
sequence of corrections.  The photo in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study1">6.37</A>

is the subject of the study; it is a difficult case because it has
many defects.

<P>
Before we begin, several observations can be made concerning this
photo:
<UL>
<LI>It is dark and clearly underexposed.
<LI>The colors are muddy and there is an overall lack of sharpness.
<LI>The photo has a green tinge or color cast to it.
<LI>There is an unsightly bright green spot on the lefthand side of the
photo that will blemish the final product if not removed.
<LI>
The subject matter, the cowboy roper with the children, is
poorly separated from the background.
</UL>In a nutshell, this photo needs a lot of help.  It will be
significantly enhanced by the steps described in the rest of this
section.

<P>
The first step, as described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#s6.tonal-range">6.1</A>, is to
maximize the tonal range<A NAME="9367">&#160;</A> of the image.
This is done by opening the <TT>Levels</TT> tool and choosing Auto
Levels.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study2">6.38</A>(b)
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.touchup.case-study2">&#160;</A><A NAME="9492">&#160;</A>

</DIV>
<BR>
shows the result.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study2">6.38</A>(a) shows the
original image for comparison purposes.  In addition to selecting Auto
Levels, the midtone slider control in the Value channel has been
adjusted to lighten the result a bit.  Notice that the green color
cast has been greatly diminished by the <TT>Levels</TT> tool adjustment,
and the colors seem much clearer.

<P>
The second step is to correct for any remaining color
casts.<A NAME="9378">&#160;</A>  As described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node61.html#s6.neutrals">6.2.2</A>, this is accomplished using the <TT>Color
Picker</TT><A NAME="9381">&#160;</A> to measure neutral colors in the
image.  The cowboy trick-roper and children are standing on a stone
surface that appears to be granite.  It is reasonable to guess that
this stone should be a neutral gray.

<P>
With the <TT>Color Picker</TT>, you can see that there are actually a
range of values from shadows to midtones in this stone.  Measuring the
image colors at several locations yields a representative shadow value
of 
<!-- MATH: $59^R 49^G 42^B$ -->
59<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 49<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 42<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> in the dark stone just to the left of the roper's
lower legs.  Similar measurements made in the lighter stone just
beneath the little boy's feet yield a midtone value of 
<!-- MATH: $119^R 120^G
109^B$ -->
119<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 120<SUP><I>G</I></SUP>
109<SUP><I>B</I></SUP>.  From these two measurements, it seems there is a brown/orange
cast to the image.  As for a representative highlight value, the right
rear part of the lasso loop should be neutral but is measured at

<!-- MATH: $177^R 183^G 167^B$ -->
177<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 183<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 167<SUP><I>B</I></SUP>.  This is a pale green.

<P>
To remove these color casts, the <TT>Curves</TT> tool is used as
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node61.html#s6.neutrals">6.2.2</A>.  For this case study, the
shadow values of red at 59 and green at 49 are both moved to match the
blue at 42.  The midtone values of green at 120 and blue at 109 are
both matched to the red at 119.  Finally, the highlight values of green
at 183 and blue at 167 are balanced to the red at 177.  The result is
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study3">6.39</A>(b).

<BR>
In comparing this image to the previous one, shown again in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study3">6.39</A>(a), the stone is now clearly a more
neutral gray.  Also, you can see that the skin tones had a slight
orange tinge, which has been removed.

<P>
The next step is to remove the green glint at the middle left side of
the image.  This is done as described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#s6.clone-tool">6.3</A>
using the <TT>Clone</TT> tool.  The image without this blemish is shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study4">6.40</A>.

<P>
At this point in the sequence of corrections, it should be clear that
you cannot get additional subject detail using the methods from
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node61.html#s6.detail">6.2.6</A>.  The cowboy and children already fill the
entire range of tonal values from the darkest shadows in the cowboy's
shirt to the brightest highlights in the rope and the little girl's
collar.  The only way to get more out of this image is to try and
separate the subject from the background, which can only be
accomplished by making a selection.<A NAME="9401">&#160;</A>

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study5">6.41</A>

</DIV>
<BR>
shows the selection that was made using the <TT>Bezier Path</TT> tool.
The selection was made in several stages.  The main outline of the
subject was made first. Three regions were then removed from this
first selection by using the method for subtracting selections described
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#s3-2.combining-selections">3.2</A>.  These regions are the two
enclosures the rope makes with the roper's body and the small hole
between the roper's and little girl's leg.

<P>
Inverting the selection by typing <TT>C-i</TT> in the image window, the
background can be lightened by using the
perturbation<A NAME="9411">&#160;</A> method described
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node61.html#s6.perturbation-technique">6.2.5</A> to adjust the Value channel
of the <TT>Curves</TT> tool.  As shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study6">6.42</A>(b), the result produces a subject
that

is better defined against the background.  This is compared with the
image from the previous step, which is shown again in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study6">6.42</A>(a).

<P>
The final enhancement to the image is to sharpen the subject a bit.
This is done using the <TT>Unsharp Mask</TT> as described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node63.html#s6.unsharp-mask">6.4.1</A>.  The <TT>Unsharp Mask</TT> parameters were
chosen to be 3 for Radius and 0.5 for Amount.  The final
result is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study7">6.43</A>(b),

and Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study7">6.43</A>(a) shows the initial image from
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node64.html#f.touchup.case-study1">6.37</A>.  The comparison of the two images
is dramatic.  The original seemed unretrievable, and, although the
final result is perhaps unworthy of <EM>National Geographic</EM>
magazine, it is, nevertheless, greatly improved.

<P>
The new image has several qualities worth noting.  First, the colors
of the enhanced image are much sharper and better defined.  In
comparison, the original image's colors are muddy.  This is due
primarily to the enhancement to the tonal range.  Second, the green
tinge seen in the original image has been eliminated; the subject of
the enhanced image is also sharper and better defined against the
background.  This is due to the <TT>Unsharp Mask</TT> and the
reprocessing of the background with the help of selection tools and
the <TT>Curves</TT> tool.
