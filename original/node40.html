3.5 Using Selections Effectively
</H1>

<P>
This section begins the discussion of how to effectively use the
selection tools presented in this chapter.  The full story, however,
won't be completed until we cover masks in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node42.html#c4.masks">4</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001151000000000000000">&#160;</A>

3.5.1 General Selection Tool Guidelines
</H2>

<P>
This chapter has presented the six selection tools from the Toolbox as
well as the <TT>By Color</TT> selection tool.  This leaves you with
quite a few choices.  So, the question naturally arises, ``Which is
the best tool to use?''  This section summarizes the tools discussed
so far and describes their strengths and weaknesses.

<P>
The order of the summary is from the most useful selection tool to the
least:
<UL>
<LI><TT>Bezier Path</TT><A NAME="3945">&#160;</A>: Of the seven choices, this
is the most useful selection tool because it is the most flexible and
the most versatile.  Combined with the associated tools available in
the Paths dialog, this is the selection tool that will usually get the
job done in the least amount of time.

<P>
The <TT>Bezier Path</TT> selection tool is not, however, a panacea.  When
the selection subject's boundary is not smooth, it is impractical to
use the <TT>Bezier Path</TT> tool.  Examples of difficult selections with
this tool would be the image of a leafy tree or one of a woman's hair
blowing in the breeze.  For these types of selections, other
approaches are necessary (see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node42.html#c4.masks">4</A>).

<P>
<LI><TT>Lasso</TT><A NAME="3950">&#160;</A><A NAME="3951">&#160;</A>:
Although this tool is not useful for precision selection work, it is
probably still the next most useful selection tool.  The <TT>Lasso</TT>
is the best selection tool when only a rough selection is needed.
Good examples of using the <TT>Lasso</TT> to separate image elements is
illustrated in Sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#s4.threshold">4.5.3</A> and
<A HREF="node69.html#s7.compositing.proj4">7.4</A>.

<P>
<LI><TT>Rectangle Select</TT><A NAME="3957">&#160;</A>: This selection
tool is about as useful as the <TT>Lasso</TT>.  However, it is used for
very different reasons.  This tool is valuable for framing (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#s2.layers.layer-resize">2.6.2</A>) and for the selective
application of filters and gradients to layer edges (see, for example,
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#s7.blending">7.5.3</A>).

<P>
<LI><TT>By Color</TT><A NAME="3962">&#160;</A>: This selection tool is
most useful for making selections in images that have several regions
that consist of an almost uniform color.  Examples of this would be
trying to select a large-font, solid-color text on a photographic
image background or a complicated bitmapped image.  See
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node77.html#s8.carved">8.6</A> for a practical example.

<P>
<LI><TT>Ellipse Select</TT><A NAME="3965">&#160;</A>: This tool, like <TT>Rectangle Select</TT>, is also used for framing.  An example of using <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> in this way is shown in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3.feathering">3.1.2</A>.
It is also occasionally useful for selecting shapes that are known to
be elliptical or circular, such as the clock illustrated in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#s3.guides">3.5.4</A>.  This tool, however, is used less often than
<TT>Rectangle Select</TT>.

<P>
<LI><TT>Magic Wand</TT><A NAME="3972">&#160;</A><A NAME="3973">&#160;</A>: This
tool is based on a great concept but is difficult to use in practice.
Fortunately, there is another technique based on almost the same idea
but producing results with much greater control and flexibility.  This
technique is based on the <TT>Threshold</TT> tool, which is described in
more detail in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#s4.threshold">4.5.3</A>.

<P>
<LI><TT>Intelligent Scissors</TT><A NAME="3977">&#160;</A>: In principle
this tool should be good at selecting shapes that do not have smooth
outlines, the shapes that are difficult for the <TT>Bezier Path</TT>
tool.  Unfortunately, the performance of this tool is poor and I,
personally, never use it.  I rank this tool as the least useful for
making selections.

3.5.2 Tool Conjugation
</H2>

<P>
Often a selection is most efficiently made using a combination of
tools.  For example, beginning a selection with the <TT>Magic
Wand</TT><A NAME="3984">&#160;</A><A NAME="3985">&#160;</A> or with <TT>By
Color</TT> can produce a result that is almost right but may be missing a
component or may have included an unwanted element.  When this
happens, the <TT>Lasso</TT> can often be used to correct the problem.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.conjugate">3.25</A>(a)
<BR>

<BR>
shows the selection of a flower made with the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>.  As
can be seen, the flower has been almost completely selected.  However,
it was impossible to include the central region of the flower by
interactively adjusting the threshold without also including more of
the background.  The value of the threshold used in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.conjugate">3.25</A>(a) is seen in the <TT>Tool
Options</TT> dialog for the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>, shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.conjugate">3.25</A>(b).  The value of 59.9 seen in the
dialog is just at the point where parts of the background started to
be included in the selection.

<P>
Although the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> could not select all the desired parts
of the flower, the remainder can be added to the selection using the
<TT>Lasso</TT>.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.conjugate">3.25</A>(c) shows the process
of making a selection with the <TT>Lasso</TT>.  Pressing the Shift key
before clicking and dragging in the image window causes the new
selection to be added to the one created by the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>.  The
Shift key needs to be released before the selection is finished.
Adding selections was described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#s3-2.combining-selections">3.2</A>.  Notice that under these
circumstances the selection made with the <TT>Lasso</TT> need not be
precise, which corresponds to the guidelines given for the <TT>Lasso</TT>
in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#s3.guidelines">3.5.1</A>.

<P>
The example of conjugating tools presented here is a little contrived
because it is not often that the <TT>Magic Wand</TT> can be used
practically in this way.  But it is illustrative of how the tools can
be used together.  We will see much more of this in
Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node42.html#c4.masks">4</A> and <A HREF="node65.html#c7.compositing">7</A> where the <TT>Threshold</TT> tool takes the place of the <TT>Magic Wand</TT>.

3.5.3 Using <TT>Zoom</TT>
</H2>

<P>
One of the most useful tools that can be used in conjunction with the
<TT>Bezier Path</TT> selection tool is the <TT>Zoom</TT> tool, found in the
Toolbox and in the <TT>Image:View</TT> menu.  This tool was covered in
some detail in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node23.html#s1.zoom">1.8.1</A>; however, its value for aiding
selections is emphasized here.

<P>
When attempting to perform a precise selection of a subject, it is
essential to get in close to the pixels.

<BR>
shows a Bezier path of an airplane that is to be converted to a
selection.  However, prior to the conversion it is desirable to
examine the path to verify its accuracy.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.zoom1">3.26</A>(b) is a 400% zoom of
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.zoom1">3.26</A>(a).  As can be seen the control point
of the Bezier path located at the junction of the right wing and the
fuselage is not quite correctly positioned.  It is only through the
use of <TT>Zoom</TT> that such a careful examination of the selection can
be made.  It is quite easy to improve the positioning of the control
point using the Edit Point mode button in the Paths dialog.

<P>
Although the <TT>Zoom</TT> tool was used in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.zoom1">3.26</A>(b) to verify a Bezier path, it is
often a good strategy to draw the path from the start in a zoomed
window.  A useful tool for helping with this is the <TT>Navigation
Window</TT>,<A NAME="4032">&#160;</A> found in the <TT>Image:View</TT> menu.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.zoom1">3.26</A>(c) illustrates this tool, which
consists of a thumbnail of the image with a panning rectangle
superimposed on it.  This panning rectangle shows the part of the
image that can be viewed in the zoomed image window.  The panning
rectangle can be dragged with the left mouse button, and this makes
the image in the zoomed window move in tandem with it.  In addition to
the panning function of the <TT>Navigation Window</TT> it also contains +
and - buttons, which can control the amount of zoom applied to the
image window.

3.5.4 Selections and Guides
</H2>

<P>
The image window guides (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#s2.guides">2.6.1</A>) can be used to
accurately positioning a selection made with the <TT>Ellipse Select</TT>
or <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> tools.  An example of the former is
illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node40.html#f.selections.guides">3.27</A>.

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
The figure shows a clock and also shows horizontal and vertical
guides that have been
positioned tangent to the perimeter of the clock's upper and left
edges.

<P>
Choosing the <TT>Ellipse Select</TT> tool from the Toolbox, the selection
is begun by clicking and dragging from the intersection of the two
guides.  If the <TT>Snap to Guides</TT> checkbox in the <TT>Image:View</TT>
menu is toggled on, the initial point for the selection snaps to the
guides' intersection.  Because the guides are tangent to the clock's
perimeter, dragging the mouse until the selection touches the two
tangent points perfectly completes the selection.
