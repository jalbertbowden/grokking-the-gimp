3.4 The Paths Dialog
</H1>

<P>
Because Bezier paths are so useful, there is a special Paths dialog
that allows multiple Bezier paths to be edited, managed, and saved.
The Paths dialog, shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog1">3.21</A>,

is displayed by typing <TT>C-l</TT> in the image window to produce the
<TT>Layers &amp; Channels</TT> window and, then, clicking on the Paths tab.
The elements of the Paths dialog are described in this section.

3.4.1 The Paths Palette
</H2>

<P>
The most important part of the Paths dialog is the Paths Palette.  The
palette contains horizontal strips, where each strip represents a
single path for the image.  Each strip contains a Path Thumbnail, a
Path Title, and a Path Transform Lock.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog1">3.21</A> illustrates a Paths Palette
containing three strips.  The top strip is highlighted in blue,
indicating that it represents the active path.  Only the active path
can be seen and manipulated in the image window.  Clicking on a path
strip in the Paths Palette makes that path active and also makes it
visible in the image window.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog2">3.22</A>(a)

illustrates an image window where the path visibility has been toggled
on by clicking on its strip in the Paths Palette.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog2">3.22</A>(b) shows the associated Paths
dialog.  To toggle off the path's visibility, it is necessary to click
on a tool icon (other than the one for the <TT>Bezier Path</TT>) in the
Toolbox window.

<P>
A path's title can be changed<A NAME="3881">&#160;</A><A NAME="3882">&#160;</A> by double-clicking in
the title area.  This brings up a dialog where the text of the new
title can be entered.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog2">3.22</A>(c)
illustrates the dialog for changing the Path Title.

<P>
Finally, the Path Transform Lock<A NAME="3884">&#160;</A> can be
toggled on and off by clicking to the left of the Path Thumbnail.
When the icon is toggled on, the path's shape is locked to the active
layer with respect to the <TT>Transform</TT> tool.  This means that any
transform applied to the active layer is also applied to the path.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog3">3.23</A>

<BR>
illustrates an example of using the Path Transform Lock.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog3">3.23</A>(a) shows the Path Transform
Lock has been toggled on for the path in the top path strip.  This
path corresponds to the outline of the blue shape in the image window
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog3">3.23</A>(b).  The image window
consists of two layers: a white background and the blue shape, the
latter which is the active layer.  Because of the Path Transform Lock,
applying the <TT>Transform</TT> tool will affect the blue shape and the
path defining the shape's boundary.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog3">3.23</A>(c) shows the dialog for the
<TT>Transform</TT> tool.  The Perspective radio button has been selected,
and the Show path checkbox has been toggled on.  This last button
makes the active path visible in the image window while it is being
transformed.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog3">3.23</A>(d) shows the
perspective transform of the grid and the active path.  When the
transform is actually performed by clicking on the Transform button in
the <TT>Perspective Transform</TT> dialog, the result is as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog3">3.23</A>(e).  The active layer
containing the shape is transformed and the path associated with this
shape is transformed along with it.

<P>
The ability to see a path superimposed on the transform grid while
performing a transformation of a layer is a particularly useful
capability.  There is no more precise way of warping one image to
another than with this feature.  A concrete example of using the Path
Transform Lock is illustrated in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node67.html#s7.compositing.proj2">7.2</A>.

3.4.2 The Control Point Mode Buttons
</H2>

<P>
The Control Point Mode Buttons are shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-dialog1">3.21</A>.  These consist of the New
Point,<A NAME="3905">&#160;</A> Add Point<A NAME="3906">&#160;</A>, Delete Point<A NAME="3907">&#160;</A>, and Edit Point<A NAME="3908">&#160;</A> buttons.  These control the behavior, or mode,
of mouse clicks in the image window when you're using the <TT>Bezier
Path</TT> tool.

<P>
When using the <TT>Bezier Path</TT> tool with the New Point mode button
selected in the Paths dialog, there are two behaviors for a mouse click
in the image window.  The first behavior is associated to working on
an open path.  In this case, clicking in the image window creates a
new control point that is immediately connected to the last control
point on the path by a path segment.  The last new control point on an
open path is displayed as a circle outline.  All the other points on
the path are displayed as solid circles.  

<P>
The second behavior of the New Point mode button is when there is no
open path.  Then, a mouse click in the image window initializes a new
path.  

<P>
When the Bezier path is in New Point mode, the mouse cursor appears in
the image window as an arrow with a filled circle below it.  This
indicates that the next mouse click will create a new control point.

<P>
The Add Point mode button is for adding a point to a path segment
between two existing control points.  This is useful when a path has
been created but doesn't have a sufficient number of points to
properly follow the desired shape.  When the Add Point mode button is
active, the mouse cursor changes to an arrow with a plus symbol below
it whenever the cursor is close enough to a path segment to add a
point.  If the mouse button is not released when the point is added,
the point can immediately be edited.  In other words, if the mouse
button remains pressed the control handles will appear when you drag
the mouse, and the Shift and Control keys can be used to manipulate
the control point and the control handles.  This is a handy feature
because a control point can be added to a path and then immediately
edited without having to return to the Paths menu.

<P>
The Delete Point mode button removes control points from a Bezier
path.  This can be used to delete extraneous control points or those
that were added accidentally.  When you use the Delete Point mode
button, the mouse cursor changes to an arrow with a minus symbol below
it whenever the cursor is close enough to a control point to delete it.
If the Shift key is pressed while using the Delete Point mode button,
the mouse click deletes the entire path.

<P>
Finally, the Edit Point mode button allows the control handles to be
manipulated and the control points to be moved, as described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3.bezier-paths">3.1.1</A>.  That is, clicking and dragging on a
control point moves the point's control handles in unison.
Shift-clicking and dragging a control handle moves that handle
independently of the other one.  Control-clicking and dragging the
mouse on a control point makes the control point move, following the
mouse.  Finally, Alt-clicking and dragging the mouse on a control
point causes the entire path to follow the mouse.  When you're using
the Edit Point mode button, the mouse cursor changes to an arrow with
the outline of a square below it whenever the mouse cursor is close
enough to a control point to edit it.

3.4.3 The Paths Menu
</H2>

<P>
Like the Layers dialog and the Channels dialog, the Paths dialog also
has a menu that can be displayed by right-clicking anywhere in the
Paths Palette area.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-menu">3.24</A>(a)

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.selections.paths-menu">&#160;</A><A NAME="3917">&#160;</A>

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
shows the Paths dialog and Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#f.selections.paths-menu">3.24</A>(b) the
Paths menu.  As shown in the figure, many of the functions available
in the Paths menu can be accessed from the button bar<A NAME="3922">&#160;</A>.  However, the functions Copy Path<A NAME="3923">&#160;</A>, Paste Path,<A NAME="3924">&#160;</A> Import Path, and
Export Path are unique to the Paths menu.

<P>
The Copy Path function copies the path in the active path strip to a
buffer.  This path can then be pasted into another path strip, either
in the same image or in another, using the Paste Path function.  The
Export Path<A NAME="3925">&#160;</A> function brings up a dialog
allowing the active path to be saved to disk.  This saved path can
later be recovered using the Import Path function<A NAME="3926">&#160;</A>.

<P>
Because the remaining functions are available in the button bar, they are
described in the next section.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001144000000000000000">
3.4.4 The Paths Button Bar</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Paths dialog button bar provides access to six functions: New
Path, Duplicate Path, Path to Selection, Selection to Path, Stroke
Path, and Delete Path.

<P>
New Path and Duplicate Path are self-evident.  The New Path button
creates a new path, and the Duplicate Path button duplicates the
current active path.

<P>
The Path to Selection button converts the active path to a selection.
The path can also be converted to a selection by simply clicking
inside the path in the image window.  In either case, this causes the
selection's Marching Ants to appear in the image window but does not
necessarily cause the visibility of the path to toggle off.  To toggle
off the path's visibility, click on a tool icon, other than the one
for <TT>Bezier Path</TT>, in the Toolbox.

<P>
The Selection to Path button is the same as the <TT>To Path</TT> function
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node38.html#s3.to-path">3.3.12</A>.  Using this button converts a
selection visible in the image window to a new path in the Paths
dialog.  This becomes the active path and can be seen in the image
window.

<P>
The Stroke Path button is the same as the <TT>Stroke</TT> function
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node38.html#s3.stroke">3.3.15</A>.  It is applied to the active
path using the active brush and the active foreground color.  In
addition, the <TT>Stroke</TT> function in the Paths dialog will stroke
the path using any painting tool selected from the Toolbox.  To
specify the painting tool, you select its icon in the Toolbox just
prior to clicking the Stroke Path button in the Paths dialog.  Using
this technique the <TT>Airbrush</TT><A NAME="3935">&#160;</A> tool can be
used, for example, to stroke the path.

<P>
Finally, the Delete Path button removes the active path from the Paths
Palette.
