6.1 Improving Tonal Range
</H1>

<P>
Improving the tonal range of an image is the first step that should be
taken in almost every effort to touch up and enhance a photo.  
To do this, it is necessary to understand the basic elements
of tonal range and the tools the GIMP provides to measure and
affect it.

6.1.1 Highlights and Shadows
</H2>

<P>
What is tonal range?  To answer this question, let's look at the
grayscale photo shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale">6.1</A>(a).
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.touchup.grayscale">&#160;</A><A NAME="8770">&#160;</A>
<TABLE WIDTH="50%">
<CAPTION><STRONG>Figure 6.1:</STRONG>
Highlights and Shadows in a Grayscale Image</CAPTION>
<TR><TD><IMG
 SRC="img203.gif"
ALT="Figure 6.1"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
The figure shows a tiger image consisting of a complete range of
grayscale values from 0, or completely black, to 255, fully white.
Furthermore, from the histogram<A NAME="8774">&#160;</A> shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale">6.1</A>(b), you can see that the
distribution of pixel values in the image smoothly covers the entire
available range.  The histogram shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale">6.1</A>(b) is part of the <TT>Levels</TT> tool,
which is discussed in detail in the next section.

<P>
The lightest part of an image is called the <EM>highlight</EM> and the
darkest is called the <EM>shadow</EM>.  It is important to note that not
all images will have the maximum highlight of 255 and/or the minimum
shadow of 0.  Thus, the tonal range of an image is just the numeric
difference between the image's maximum highlight and its minimum
shadow.  You will see shortly that measuring highlight and shadow
values is useful for performing image enhancement, but before
developing this idea, let's examine why tonal range is so important.

<P>
Having a full tonal range is generally a good thing.  A full tonal
range means that the image has, in a general sense, the fullest
possible contrast.  To illustrate this idea, the tonal range of the
image in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale">6.1</A>(a) can be synthetically
diminished by setting the output sliders of the <TT>Levels</TT> tool to
values well inside the range of 0 to 255.  This adjustment is shown
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale2">6.2</A>(b),
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.touchup.grayscale2">&#160;</A><A NAME="8784">&#160;</A>
<TABLE WIDTH="50%">
<CAPTION><STRONG>Figure 6.2:</STRONG>

<TR><TD><IMG

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
and the result on the image is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale2">6.2</A>(c).  Here, you can see the effect of
compressing the tonal range.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale2">6.2</A>(b)
shows the settings of the <TT>Levels</TT> tool used to limit the tonal
range.  Notice that the resulting contrast of the image in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale2">6.2</A>(c) is much poorer than the contrast
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.grayscale2">6.2</A>(a).  The image with the smaller
tonal range looks muddy and washed out in comparison to the original.

<P>
This example is based on a grayscale image whose tonal range has been
synthetically impoverished.  Nevertheless, the conclusions that can be
drawn from it are general.  That is, maximizing tonal range is usually
a great way to enhance an image.  However, sometimes it is better not
to maximize the tonal range.  An image of white lace gloves on a white
linen tablecloth background is such an example.  Under these
circumstances, there is a subtle interplay of whites and off-whites in
the image, and a deep black shadow is most likely undesirable.  In
most cases, however, getting the most tonal range out of an image
improves contrast, which in turn significantly enhances the image.

6.1.2 Using the <TT>Levels</TT> Tool
</H2>

<P>
The <TT>Levels</TT> tool is found in the <TT>Image:Image/Colors</TT> menu,
and it was used in the previous section to examine the tonal range of
a grayscale image.  The features of this tool and how it can be
applied to color images is discussed in detail here.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels0">6.3</A>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.touchup.levels0">&#160;</A><A NAME="9438">&#160;</A>
<TABLE WIDTH="50%">

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<BR>
illustrates the <TT>Levels</TT> dialog.  Note that the Channels menu is
open in the figure, showing five different channels that can be
displayed and modified.  Because we are interested in color
correction, only the Red, Green, and Blue channels apply in this
section.

<P>
The histogram is a very important feature of the <TT>Levels</TT> tool
because it immediately shows whether a channel occupies its entire
tonal range or not.  Just below the histogram is a grayscale called
the <EM>input value domain</EM>.<A NAME="8808">&#160;</A>  In this
grayscale, black represents pixel values of 0 and white values of 255.
Thus, for the Green channel shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels0">6.3</A>,
the black of the input value domain represents dark values of green
and the white represents bright values of green.  Having no histogram
over a part of the input value range means that there are no pixels in
the image having these values.  Thus, in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels0">6.3</A>, you can see that there is a lack of
tonal range because there are significant parts of the upper and lower
input value range that have no histogram values over them.

<P>
The remaining features of the <TT>Levels</TT> dialog are for adjusting
the distribution of the histogram.  The leftmost and rightmost arrows
of the <EM>input control slider</EM><A NAME="8813">&#160;</A> are used
for stretching the tonal range of the image; the middle arrow can be
used to warp the range.  The leftmost arrow is called the shadow
control arrow, the rightmost is the highlight control arrow, and the
middle is the midtone control arrow.  The arrows of the <EM>output
control slider</EM><A NAME="8815">&#160;</A> are used for shrinking
the tonal range.  Adjustments to the control arrows can be made
interactively by clicking and dragging them.  The arrows can also be
controlled numerically by entering values for the min, gamma, and max
input levels or for the min and max output levels.

<P>
The following example shows how the adjustment features of the <TT>Levels</TT> tool function.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels1">6.4</A>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.touchup.levels1">&#160;</A><A NAME="8819">&#160;</A>

</DIV>
<BR>
shows an image that has a severely compressed tonal range.  This can
be seen by looking at the distribution of pixel values in the Red,
Green, and Blue channels shown in Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels2">6.5</A>(a),
(b), and (c), respectively.

The figure shows that the Red channel has the poorest tonal range.
The Green and Blue channels, which are similar to each other, have
tonal ranges that are hardly much better.

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels3">6.6</A>

which shows that this simple readjustment of levels, producing a
maximum tonal range, has greatly improved the image.  The turtle now
seems to pop right off the page, and the depth of field seems almost
three dimensional.  In comparison, the turtle in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels1">6.4</A> seems flat, the colors are muddy, and
the image lacks life.

<P>
The maximization of an image's tonal range using the <TT>Levels</TT> tool
can introduce color casts (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node61.html#s6.color-casts">6.2</A> for a
definition of color casts).  In fact, the turtle in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels4">6.7</A> appears to have a slight magenta cast.
But don't worry!  Color casts introduced using the <TT>Levels</TT> tool
can be corrected using the <TT>Curves</TT> tool, which is treated in the
next section.

<P>
A final note before leaving this section is appropriate.  The <TT>Levels</TT> dialog shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#f.touchup.levels0">6.3</A> shows a button
labeled Auto Levels.  This button pretty much automates what has been
described in this section.  That is, it maximizes the tonal range in
the Red, Green, and Blue channels.  In fact, it moves the shadow and
highlight input control sliders for each channel to about the 5% and
95% points of the histogram.  After applying Auto Levels, any of the
Red, Green, or Blue channels can be reviewed and modified.
