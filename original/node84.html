9.5 Web-Safe Color
</H1>

<P>
A problem with the exchange of images on the Internet is that not all
computers have the capability of displaying a large number of colors
simultaneously.  For example, a computer using a display resolution of

<!-- MATH: $1024\times 768$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$1024\times 768$">
and using 1 byte (8 bits)<A NAME="13452">&#160;</A> of color
per pixel requires at least 0.786 Mb of RAM on the video adapter card.
Such a system is capable of displaying only 2<SUP>8</SUP>=256 colors
simultaneously.

<P>
Alternatively, a system that is using 2 bytes (16 bits)<A NAME="13453">&#160;</A> per pixel can display 
<!-- MATH: $2^{16}=65,536$ -->
2<SUP>16</SUP>=65,536 colors, and 3 bytes (24
bits)<A NAME="13455">&#160;</A> per pixel can display 
<!-- MATH: $2^{24}=16,777,216$ -->
2<SUP>24</SUP>=16,777,216colors.  Thus, the available color palette grows significantly on a 16
bits-per-pixel (bpp) system.  A 24 bpp system is known as a true or
high color system.  However, the demands on the video adapter for
these systems also grows.  A 16 bpp system on a 
<!-- MATH: $1024\times 768$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$1024\times 768$">
pixel
display requires about 1.6 Mb of video RAM and a 24 bpp system
requires 2.4 Mb.

<P>
Many video adapter cards have only 1 Mb or less of RAM.  Although this
is less and less common with current computers being delivered with up
to 32 Mb of video RAM, there are still many legacy machines that have
smaller quantities.  The consequence is that an image containing more
than 256 colors cannot be faithfully displayed on machines with only
an 8 bpp color depth.  Some of the original colors in the image will
have to be replaced because of the lack of a sufficient number of
available colors on the displaying system.  This replacement creates
color distortion in the displayed image.

<P>
The GIMP uses 24 bits per pixel to represent color, 8 bits for each of
the R, G, and B channels.  Thus, the GIMP can easily generate images
that have color distortion when displayed on low color systems.  This
is a concern for the Web designer who wants to ensure an accurate
representation of color for his or her graphics.  This section
discusses the issues of preparing web-safe color graphics and how to
achieve this in the GIMP.

9.5.1 Types of Color Distortion
</H2>

<P>
Color distortion occurs when the monitor is already displaying all the
colors it can, and a request for a new color is made.  The least
sophisticated way of handling this request is by color
clipping.<A NAME="13461">&#160;</A><A NAME="13462">&#160;</A>
This approach displays new colors using the closest color from the
palette already being displayed.  For images with subtle color
shading, this can give rise to banding<A NAME="13463">&#160;</A>, which is also called posterization<A NAME="13464">&#160;</A>.  An example of this type of color distortion is
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>.

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(a) shows the original
image and Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(b) the same
image on a system with insufficient colors.
You can plainly see the banding of colors in this image.

<P>
The other type of color distortion is called dithering<A NAME="13473">&#160;</A>.  Although dithering is a color distortion, this
is not a bug, it's a feature!  Dithering is a technique used to
simulate unavailable colors by spatially mixing the available ones as
a mesh of small dots.  The idea is that color dithering is more
visually acceptable than color banding.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(c) illustrates the effect
of dithering.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(f) shows a
zoomed version of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(c) so
that you can see the mix of small dots used to simulate unavailable
colors.  Compare this zoomed image with the zooms of the original and
color clipped images shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(d) and (e), respectively.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A> shows that dithering is a
much more sophisticated approach to the problem of color distortion
than is banding.  For continuous gradients of color, the rule seems to
be that the dithering approach is superior.  However, there are
caveats to this rule.  To see why, you need to understand how
dithering works.  A simple illustration is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>, where

a crude dithering scheme is employed using the <TT>Checkerboard</TT><A NAME="13486">&#160;</A><A NAME="13487">&#160;</A>
plug-in (found in <TT>Image:Filters/Render/Pattern</TT> menu).  The <TT>Checkerboard</TT> dialog is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(b).  This plug-in creates a
checkerboard pattern in the active layer using the colors specified by
the <TT>Active Foreground Color</TT> and the <TT>Active Background
Color</TT>.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(a) shows that these
colors have been set to red and green.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(b) shows that a 1-pixel check
size is being used by the <TT>Checkerboard</TT> plug-in.  The result is a
simulated dither of the color yellow, as you can see in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(c).  That the resulting dithered
color is yellow follows from the discussions of the RGB colorspace in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node50.html#s5.rgb-colorspace">5.1</A>.  The vector sum of red and green
in the RGB cube yields yellow.

<P>
A zoomed version of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(c) is shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(d).  This plainly shows the
red and green checks.  For comparison purposes, a pure yellow is shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A>(e).  The example shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.dithering">9.24</A> is exaggerated because it is
never necessary to dither two colors as distant from each other in the
color cube as are red and green.  However, it nicely illustrates how
dithering works.

<P>
The dithering algorithms used in the GIMP are far more sophisticated
than that illustrated in our checkerboard example.  In the GIMP,
several dithering algorithms are available including the
Floyd-Steinberg algorithm.<A NAME="13502">&#160;</A>
The main feature of Floyd-Steinberg dithering is that it uses a
pseudo-random spatial distribution of up to three colors to simulate
an unavailable color.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.color-distortion">9.23</A>(f)
clearly shows the pseudo-random nature of Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
In many cases, it is this pseudo-random aspect of Floyd-Steinberg
dithering that improves the overall perception of a dithered color
image...but not always.  See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#s9.best-choice">9.5.4</A> for more
on this subject.

9.5.2 Low-Color Systems and Web Browser <BR>
Color Palettes
</H2>

<P>
A low color system provides only 8 bits of color per pixel, which
allows only 256 colors to be simultaneously displayed.  When used on
low-color systems, Web browsers must choose how to represent
unavailable colors.  Browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet
Explorer use color palette systems that are similar but not identical.
The colors that these two browsers have in common are known as the
web-safe color palette
[<A
 HREF="node87.html#weinman">12</A>].  Any designer that is concerned with avoiding color
distortion must be aware of this special palette and how to use it.

<P>
The web-safe color palette consists of combinations of the six values
0, 51, 102, 153, 204, 255 in each of the three colors red, green, and
blue.  Thus, using notation introduced in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node50.html#s5.rgb-colorspace">5.1</A>, 
<!-- MATH: $51^R 204^G 153^B$ -->
51<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 204<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 153<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> is a color from
the web-safe color palette, and 
<!-- MATH: $52^R 204^G 153^B$ -->
52<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 204<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 153<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> is not. The total
number of colors in the palette is 6<SUP>3</SUP>=216.  The reason six values
are used is because seven would create too many colors for a low-color
system (that is, 7<SUP>3</SUP>=343).  What happens to the remaining 40 colors
available on a low color system?  They are used for system specific
colors, and these uses differ for Mac and PC and for Netscape
Navigator and Internet Explorer.  The bottom line is you can't rely on
them.

<P>
If you are using the GIMP's drawing and painting tools to create
graphics from scratch and you desire the result to be web-safe, it
would be useful to have a palette of the 216 web-safe colors to work
with.  You could use this palette to select the colors for your
graphics, knowing that the result will be the same on most all
systems, low color or not.  The GIMP has a variety of predefined color
palettes available in the <TT>Color Palette</TT> dialog found in the <TT>Image:Dialogs/Palette</TT> menu or which can be obtained by typing <TT>C-p</TT> in the image or toolbox windows.

<P>
Of interest is the GIMP's Web color palette<A NAME="13513">&#160;</A> shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.web-palette">9.25</A>.

<BR>
The Web palette illustrates the 216 web-safe colors that can be used
on low color systems without fear of color distortion.  However,
because the colors are disorganized in this palette, it is of limited
use as a tool for creative design.  A palette that organizes colors by
hue, saturation, and value would be much more useful.

<P>
The VisiBone palettes at
<A NAME="tex2html321"
 HREF="http://www.visibone.com/swatches" target="new"><TT>http://www.visibone.com/swatches</TT></A>
are just such tools.  The VisiBone2<A NAME="13522">&#160;</A><A NAME="13523">&#160;</A> palette is
illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.visibone">9.26</A>.

The VisiBone2 palette has exactly the same web-safe colors as the
GIMP's Web palette, but the advantage is that its colors are organized
into a logical color wheel.  It is much easier to pick out colors of
common hue, saturation, and value with the VisiBone2 palette than it
is for the Web palette.

9.5.3 Converting to Indexed Color
</H2>

<P>
For display on 8-bit (low-color) systems, the best way to control the
color in an image is to convert it to Indexed format.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.convert2indexed">9.27</A>(a)

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="f.web_centric.convert2indexed">&#160;</A><A NAME="13536">&#160;</A>

illustrates the <TT>Indexed Color Conversion</TT> dialog which is invoked
by the <TT>Indexed</TT><A NAME="13542">&#160;</A> function found in the
<TT>Image:Image/Mode</TT> menu.

<P>
The dialog allows the choice of three types of palettes.  The first
option, Generate Optimal Palette, is based on the colors actually in
the image.  The number of colors used in this palette can be specified
up to a maximum of 256.  

<P>
The second option, Use Custom Palette, allows you to select from a
large collection of palettes including user-defined ones.  The names
of the GIMP's standard palettes are shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.convert2indexed">9.27</A>(b) and (c).  The default
custom palette, Web, is optimized for display on low-color systems
using browsers such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer.  This
consists of the 216 color, web-safe color palette illustrated in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.web-palette">9.25</A>.  Choosing this option
guarantees that the resulting indexed image will display with the same
colors on almost all systems.

<P>
The final palette option choice, shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.convert2indexed">9.27</A>, is the Use Black/White
(1-bit) Palette.  This option converts the image to a true black and
white (no grays) Indexed format.

<P>
The second area in the <TT>Indexed Color Conversion</TT> dialog is for
dithering options.  The following are the choices:
<UL>
<LI>No colour dithering
<LI>Positioned colour dithering
<LI>Floyd-Steinberg colour dithering (reduced colour bleeding)
<LI>Floyd-Steinberg colour dithering (normal)
</UL>Normal Floyd-Steinberg dithering is the default.  Some experimentation
might be necessary to find the best conversion to Indexed, especially if
the image consists of smooth color variations and large solid color
regions.  Read on!

9.5.4 What Is the Best Choice?
</H2>

<P>
Given that the designer chooses to limit the color palette to one
that is web-safe, converting to Indexed format still requires making
choices about the type of color distortion that is acceptable when it
can't be avoided.  Usually the choice depends on the type of image to
be displayed.

<P>
If the image is a photograph, or one that has smooth color variations,
chances are good that there are more than 256 colors in the image, and
many will not be from the web-safe palette.  Normally the color
distortion to photos on an 8-bit display is not noticeable, and it
could be argued that it is fruitless to convert the image to an
Indexed format under these conditions.  However, when photographs are
mixed with other graphic materials the argument is no longer valid.
Under these circumstances, the best choice is to dither.  This is
illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.choose">9.28</A>.

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.choose">9.28</A>(a) shows a splash screen used with
version 1.0.4 of the GIMP.  A dithered version of the splash screen,
obtained using the web-safe color palette, is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.choose">9.28</A>(b).  A color clipped version of the
splash screen using the same palette is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.choose">9.28</A>(c).  Due to the heavy banding seen
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.choose">9.28</A>(c), the color distortion due to
dithering, seen in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.choose">9.28</A>(b), seems much
more acceptable.  This example shows that for images with smoothly
varying color, the dithered solution is better because
clipping<A NAME="13563">&#160;</A><A NAME="13564">&#160;</A>
gives rise to a strongly objectionable color distortion.

<P>
If the image is not a photograph and does not have smoothly varying

strategy is completely different.  This is illustrated in

in the image, but they are there for antialiasing<A NAME="13573">&#160;</A>
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#s3.anti-aliasing">3.1.2</A>) and sharpness (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node63.html#s6.unsharp-mask">6.4.1</A>).  From the previous discussion, you can
see that the blue and the yellow are not from the web-safe palette,
which only take RGB components from the set of values 
<!-- MATH: $[0, 51, 102,
153, 204, 255]$ -->
[0, 51, 102,
153, 204, 255].  This means that some color distortion will be
introduced if the image is saved to Indexed format with the web-safe
palette.  Indeed, Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.fws150">9.29</A>(b) shows the
result of applying Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.fws150">9.29</A>(c) shows the result of color
clipping.

<P>
The dithering in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.fws150">9.29</A>(b) produces a very
undesirable effect.  The blue and yellow regions both suffer from
unsightly color speckle.  On the other hand, the color clipped version
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node84.html#f.web_centric.fws150">9.29</A>(c) produces a blue and a yellow
that are slightly different than those of the original.  Nevertheless,
it is likely that this result is preferable because it preserves the
homogeneity of the large, uniform color regions.

<P>
In conclusion, images that have a lot of detail and subtle color
variations are better served by dithering than color clipping.
Alternatively, images that have broad uniform color regions should
avoid dithering and use color clipping.  For images that consist of a
mix of the two conditions, some experimentation is necessary.
Unfortunately there are sometimes no easy choices.
