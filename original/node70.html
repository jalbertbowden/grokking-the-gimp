7.5 Project 5: Panoramas
</H1>

<P>
By piecing together a series of normal photographs, panoramic and wide
angle views can be created in the GIMP.  The approach of piecing
together a group of images to create a panorama instead of using
special purpose camera lenses gives rise to a number of photo
inconsistencies among the individual pieces of the image.
Nevertheless, the GIMP is perfectly capable of correcting these
problems and creating a well integrated whole.  This chapter
describes the problems involved in creating panoramas from collections
of individual images and how to overcome them in the GIMP.

<P>
To create a panorama from a collection of photos, the steps are well
defined.  First, the photos have to be grouped together into a single
image, each placed into a separate layer.  The procedure for this has
been explained many times already in this book.  In particular,
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node30.html#s2.layers.cut-paste">2.4</A> describes the copying and pasting of
images into layers, and Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#s2.layers.positioning">2.6.1</A> explains
how to position layers within an image.

illustrates a set of images, each taken with about 50% overlap, using
a digital camera.  They were stored in JPEG file format and then
individually loaded into the GIMP.  Each was then copied and pasted
into a separate layer in a single image.  Each layer was then
positioned using the <TT>Move</TT><A NAME="10890">&#160;</A> tool.  The Opacity
slider in the Layers dialog was used to facilitate the positioning of
each layer.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A>(a) shows the result after
positioning the layers as well as possible, and
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A>(b) shows the organization of the
layers in the Layers dialog.  The layers are named with the letters of
the alphabet, A through E, where A corresponds to the rightmost layer
and E to the leftmost.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A> illustrates the primary problems
that must be overcome to achieve a consistent looking panorama.  As
shown, these problems are geometric distortion, color matching, and
brightness matching.  Each of these is addressed in the following
sections.

<P>

7.5.1 Correcting Geometric Distortions
</H2>

<P>
The first step after the initial positioning of the individual layers
is to remove, as much as possible, the geometric distortions.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A>(a) has distortions that can be seen
in several places.  The two most flagrant problems are the molding
around the ceiling of the room and the alignment of the grain in the
hardwood floor, especially on the left side of the image.  However,
there are also many other small details in the image that are slightly
off kilter.  Also, there are several places where elements of the
images do not line up properly.

<P>
The first step is to correct for the misalignment problems.  Using the
Scale option of the <TT>Transform</TT> tool, some
of the layers are squeezed in an effort to make them more consistent
with the others.  A very important guideline, however, is that there
are limits to what can be done without introducing other serious
mismatches.  The goal is to adjust, but with a light hand.

<P>
Referring again to Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A>(a), perhaps the
biggest inconsistency is that the vertical scale of the image in layer
C seems to be larger than the others.  This explains the lack of
registration of the ceiling molding and the fireplace mantle for this
layer.  The remaining details might be acceptable defects.  This will
be reevaluated after the most important corrections are made.

<P>
Before you begin, it is worthwhile to point out that, of all the <TT>Transform</TT> tool options, Scaling introduces the fewest artifacts.
This is especially true when care is taken to maintain the aspect
ratio between the horizontal and vertical dimensions.  The Scaling
option of the <TT>Transform</TT> tool can be constrained to preserve
aspect ratio by pressing the Control and Alt keys together while
scaling.

<P>

<BR>
illustrates the result of using the <TT>Transform</TT> tool to adjust
layer C.  As shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-transform1">7.36</A>(b),
the tool is used with the <TT>Scaling</TT> option.  The upper-right
corner of layer C was adjusted until both the X and Y Scale Ratios
shown in the <TT>Scaling Information</TT> dialog became 0.95.

<P>
How was the value 0.95 determined?  The answer depends on whether you
are challenged by ratios.  If not, the swiftest way is to use the <TT>Measure</TT><A NAME="10914">&#160;</A> tool to determine that the height of the
molding at the left edge of layer C is 271 pixels from layer C's
bottom edge, and that the height of the molding in layer D at layer
C's left edge is 258 pixels.  This makes the ratio 
<!-- MATH: $258/271 = 0.95$ -->
258/271 = 0.95.
If you don't like ratios, a simple trial-and-error approach does not
take much more time.  Just choose a scaling factor and use <TT>C-z</TT>
to perform an undo if the scale isn't correct.  The result of the
scaling operation aligns the molding on the ceiling between layers C
and D.

<P>
As already noted, the upper right corner of layer C was used to
perform the scale.  Thus, layer C has shrunk horizontally by 5%,
shifting its right edge to the left.  This means that to properly
register with layer C, layers A and B must now be repositioned to the
left.

7.5.2 Color and Brightness Matching
</H2>

<P>
You can see that there is significant brightness variation from layer
to layer in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A>.  This is normal for
photos taken with most consumer digital and regular film cameras.
These cameras typically auto-expose scenes according to average
lighting conditions and do not offer user controls for exposure.  For
the image in layer A of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A> the light,
coming from the windows is very bright which, due to the average light
metering of the camera, causes the features of the room's interior to
be underexposed.  Thus, the room features in this layer are quite a
bit darker than in the other layers.  Otherwise, the brightness of the
other layers are more or less consistent with each other.

<P>
In addition to the brightness mismatch between layers you can also see
from Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-set">7.35</A> that there is a color balance
mismatch from layer to layer.  The combination of color and brightness
variations means that the layer boundaries are plainly visible instead
of presenting a smooth and imperceptible transition across the
panorama.

<P>
The strategy for correcting the differences in brightness and color is
to use the <TT>Curves</TT> tool.  The idea is to match color at
boundaries between layers using a method similar to that described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node61.html#s6.neutrals">6.2.2</A>.  The method measures pixel values on both
sides of a layer boundary using the <TT>Color Picker</TT><A NAME="10926">&#160;</A> tool.  The <TT>Curves</TT> tool is then used to match the
values.  This procedure corrects for both color and brightness
mismatch simultaneously.

<P>
Matching the color and brightness of two layers has a chain reaction
effect in a panorama project.  Matching layer B to its neighbor A,
means that subsequently layer C must be matched to B, and so on.
Thus, some care must be taken to avoid blowing out the available tonal
range.  Typically, the wisest decision is to choose the layer of
average brightness and to match the other layers working away from
this one.  However, for this panorama project, it is layer E that is
chosen as the reference because its lighting for the room seems the
most natural.  The work flow, then, is from the leftmost layer to the
rightmost, from layer E to layer A.

<P>
Starting with the boundary between layers E and D, a pixel value was
measured on the white wall just above the wood wainscoting.  The
measured values are 
<!-- MATH: $177^R 183^G 194^B$ -->
177<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 183<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 194<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> to the left of the boundary
and 
<!-- MATH: $153^R 156^G 171^B$ -->
153<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 156<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 171<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> to the right.  Using this information, the <TT>Curves</TT> tool is used on layer D to match the pixel values measured in
D to those of layer E.  Representative pixels are then measured across
the boundary between layer D and layer C.  Here, the measured pixel
values are located at the midway point between the hanging picture
and the ceiling molding.  The values are found to be 
<!-- MATH: $179^R 175^G
185^B$ -->
179<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 175<SUP><I>G</I></SUP>
185<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> to the left of the boundary and 
<!-- MATH: $112^R 119^G 139^B$ -->
112<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 119<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 139<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> to the
right.  The <TT>Curves</TT> tool is employed again, this time on
layer C, matching C's pixel values to those of D's.

<P>
Continuing with the boundary between layers C and B, the measured pixel
values at a point midway between the mantle and the molding are 
<!-- MATH: $201^R
197^G 211^B$ -->
201<SUP><I>R</I></SUP>
197<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 211<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> to the left and 
<!-- MATH: $101^R 99^G 112^B$ -->
101<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 99<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 112<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> to the right.  The
final boundary is between layers B and A.  Here the pixels are
measured at the midpoint between the plant and the molding.  The
values found are 
<!-- MATH: $199^R 198^G 208^B$ -->
199<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 198<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 208<SUP><I>B</I></SUP> and 
<!-- MATH: $86^R 75^G 81^B$ -->
86<SUP><I>R</I></SUP> 75<SUP><I>G</I></SUP> 81<SUP><I>B</I></SUP>.  The <TT>Curves</TT> tool is applied for each of these boundaries, as it was for
the first two.

<P>
The results of the color and brightness matching operations are shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-colormatch">7.37</A>.

The overall color and brightness of the images in the layers are now
much more consistent.  However, there continues to be sufficient
mismatch between the layers to perceive the layer boundaries.
Fortunately, this visual defect can be corrected using a layer
mask<A NAME="10937">&#160;</A> blending technique described
in the next section.

7.5.3 Blending
</H2>

<P>
The remaining color mismatches at layer edges can be corrected using
layer masks.  The idea is to blend the edges by using a gradient in a
layer mask.  The technique of layer blending using a gradient in a
layer mask is discussed in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node45.html#s4.masks.gradients">4.3.3</A>.

shows the remaining color mismatch at the edge between layers A and B.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-blend1">7.38</A>(b) shows a layer mask created
for layer A.  This mask is a black to white gradient where the black
point is placed at the left edge of the mask and the white point
slightly to the right of this.  This layer mask has the effect of
making the left side of layer A's boundary semi-transparent, letting
layer B show through.  The end result is the two layers are blended in
this small band removing the visibility of the boundary.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-blend1">7.38</A>(c) illustrates the Layers
dialog showing that four of the five layers have had layer masks
added.  This makes one layer mask for each boundary.

Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node70.html#f.panoramas.image-blend2">7.39</A>(b) shows the result after
blending.  As you can see, the technique is very effective.  However,
some experimentation was necessary to find the correct width for the
gradient blend.

<P>
Although the gradient blending trick works well in most cases, there
are times when it is not appropriate for the entire boundary between
two layers.  In this case, parts of the boundary can be targeted for a
blending gradient by using the <TT>Rectangle Select</TT> tool.  This is necessary, for example, for the blend of layers
D and E.  Here, separate selections are made at layer D's left edge
for the regions corresponding to the hardwood floor, the wainscoting,
and upper wall areas.  Separate gradient blends are produced for each
one.

<P>
The layer mask produced by these separate gradients is shown in

In addition to the crop, the layers are also merged by typing <TT>C-m</TT> in either the Layers dialog or the image window.

<P>
There is a remaining defect that still seems important in the image:
the molding along the ceiling in what was layer E before the merge.
This piece of molding is not properly aligned with that of what was
layer D.  The <TT>Clone</TT><A NAME="10980">&#160;</A><A NAME="10981">&#160;</A> tool described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#s6.clone-tool">6.3</A> can be used to repair this defect.  You
can repair the molding by cloning the lower edge of the old layer E's
visible molding to the top edge.  This makes it vertically align with
the molding in the segment from the old layer D.  After the top edge
has been reconstructed in this way, you can eliminate the lower edge
by cloning the unadorned part of the wall just below it and using this
to cover it up.  The resulting final panorama is shown in
