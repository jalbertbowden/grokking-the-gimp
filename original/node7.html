The GIMP began in the summer of 1995 as an enormously ambitious
project of two undergraduates at the University of California,
Berkeley.  When they began, they probably didn't realize just how
impossible it was, and yet, they made it work.  They created a beta
version that captured the imagination of the open-source movement.
Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis were those students, and I would like
to thank them as much for the creative inspiration they received as
for that they created in others.  This book, of course, would have
never existed without them.

The seed of inspiration planted by Peter and Spencer attracted a
talented group of core developers who have grown the GIMP into the
powerful digital image manipulation tool that it is today.  They are a
loose-knit collection of men and women from around the globe,
connected by only the thin wires of cyberspace.  Most of them have
never met face to face, and, nevertheless, they have collaborated and
cooperated on a project of significant complexity and great value.
What an amazing phenomenon the GIMP project is!  I would like to thank
each one of them.  Their names, as of version 1.1.15 of the GIMP, are
Lauri Alanko, Shawn Amundson, John Beale, Zach Beane, Tom Bech, Marc
Bless, Edward Blevins, Roberto Boyd, Stanislav Brabec, Simon Budig,
Seth Burgess, Brent Burton, Francisco Bustamante, Kenneth

Of all those in the GIMP developers group, I would like to express an
especially warm note of thanks to Karin and Olof Kylander.  They are
the authors of <EM>The GIMP User Manual</EM> (see
[<A
 HREF="node87.html#kylander">2</A>] and [<A
 HREF="node87.html#kylander2">3</A>]), the first complete reference to 
the GIMP.  I personally found it to be invaluable in the drafting of
my own book.

<P>
I would also like to thank the famous <TT>tigert</TT>, a.k.a. Tuomas
Kuosmanen, GIMP developer and GIMP artist.  He graciously accepted to
create this book's cover art.

Editorially, there are many individuals that have directly helped me in
the preparation of this book.  I'd like to start by thanking Laurie
Petrycki, executive editor at New Riders Publishing.  Laurie is a
genuine supporter of the open-source software community, and she has
done a lot to change the editorial work flow at New Riders to
accommodate authors, like me, using open-source tools.  She was
enthusiastic, open to ideas, and willing to change many boilerplate
business and design practices to make my book better.  I would highly
recommend her to anyone wanting to write an open-source software book.

<P>
I'd also like to thank Jim Chalex, my development editor.  He
encouraged me, gave good advice on improving this book's structure and
content, displayed an uncommon mastery of the comma, and came up with
a great book title.  My hat's off to you, Jim!

The technical reviewers, Guillermo Romero and Zach Beane, deserve a
lot of credit.  They both read through a difficult first draft and,
nevertheless, prepared excellent technical reviews making many useful
comments and suggestions.

I also greatly enjoyed interacting with both Louisa Klucznick and Aren
Howell, responsible for the book's design.  They taught me a lot about
paper, spot glosses, type styles, and page layouts.  My heartfelt
thanks also go to Kelli Brooks and Gayle Johnson who did a great job
of copy editing.  Finally, I'd like to thank the project editor,
Caroline Wise, who smoothly orchestrated the entire editorial, layout,
and printing process.

In addition to the list of individuals who have had an important
influence on this book, there are also several organizations that merit
acknowledgement here.  The concepts and techniques presented in this
book are greatly enhanced by a large collection of raw, digital-image
materials used to illustrate them.  The source for most of these
images is from several United States governmental agency Web sites
that generously allow their online photographic archives to be used
without copyright assertion.  These include the sites of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (FWS).  These agencies provide a wonderful resource to the
world, and I salute them.

Many thanks to all, and Happy GIMPing!</DIV>
